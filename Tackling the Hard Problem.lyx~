 Marvin Minsky, a pioneer of artificial intelligence, with his book

\begin_layout Abstract
In this thesis, after looking at those philosopher's positions on the four
 parts of the hard problem in-depth and attempting to merge their positions
 on the four parts, I present a synopsis that attempts to unify their theories
 and categorizes the processes and prerequirements which a system needs
 to satisfy in order to be able to experience subjective consciousness.
 In doing so, the thesis splits up the aforementioned four apparently time-prove
n concepts into a total of seven new concepts where one clearly forms the
 basis for the next, and by that means untangles overlapping semantic fields.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we can get to the heart of the matter of what consciousness is all
 about, we need to make sure that we are all on equal footing.
 Often, philosophers use the same terms with diverging meanings.
 Even if I take great care not to talk about Wittgensteinian 
\emph on
Scheinprobleme
\emph default
, it is important to avoid misunderstandings due to linguistic inconsistencies.
 I attempt to avoid such misunderstandings by defining major terms that
 are important for the discussion when they first appear, and clarifying
 my useage of more wide-reaching concepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us start our journey by finding out what that hard problem is.

What is generally known as

While I am in no position to criticize Metzinger's mastery of the English
 language myself, he faced a lot of criticism for his nomenclature.
 Mainly, it was said that his inventing his own names for novel concepts
 or novel views on established concepts made it harder to understand what
 he really means.
 Nevertheless I will often use his nomenclature and semantics, and attempt
 to show up what he means by some particularly peculiar expressions.

\begin_layout Standard
I want to focus on how Dennett and Metzinger (and, for subjectivity, Minsky)
 try to answer the four partial questions I mentioned, and present my arguments
 on what I perceive to be shortcomings of their theories.
 I will also attempt to combine all of their points of view into one model,
 where possible.

Finally, in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 give a more solid foundation for further research.

\begin_layout Part
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "The-Four-Questions"

\end_inset

The four questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When facing a really challenging problem, it is often best to break it up
 into smaller, hopefully less difficult problems that can be solved individually
 -- if that is even possible at all.
 The problem known as `the hard problem of consciousness,' the question
 of how it can possibly be that our brain, being a mere clump of cells,
 can produce a kind of consciousness that develops things like feelings,
 thoughts, plans and fantasies, is one such difficult problem, and it 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 possible to break it up.
 However, in doing so we have to embrace and unify concepts that have been
 subject of philosophical research for decades, subjects where every philosopher
 has his own views on how they are to be understood.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I mentioned before, there are four major aspects to it.
 These four aspects are in some ways arbitrary -- I have not found another
 list that satisfied me, and so I compiled this from the sources I found.
 However, I feel that they are able to encompass all the important parts
 that make up the hard problem, while at the same time being fine-grained
 enough to warrant that we learn something by analyzing them a bit more
 in-depth.
 I was inspired by the subjects traditionally chosen by philosophy, and
 ordered them in apparent increasing complexity.
 One part is meant to lay the foundation for the next.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, the four subjects cannot be looked at merely in isolation.
 For the time being, I do not yet intend to challenge the ways in which
 other philosophers understand one particular concept or another, but rather
 attempt to understand what different readings there are, what is the core
 of those concepts and how they are linked together.
 I postpone looking at the bigger picture to chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "The-Bigger-Picture"

\end_inset

, where we will also abandon the ordering of these four parts again and
 look at the hard problem from a different perspective.
 The resulting new levels will be placed in slightly different order compared
 to this part here, too, because some of the intuitions
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As a matter of fact, it was more than intuitions, and the genesis of this
 thesis saw multiple times that I reordered them.
 The trouble is one that we will only be able to resolve in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Summary"

\end_inset

: The four questions depend on each other.
 There are parts of phenomenality that require subjectivity, while qualia
 are the basis of phenomenality but also depend on phenomenal experience.
 Intentionality is, for some, what enables phenomenal experience, but for
 others, what phenomenal experience forms.
 With this in mind, I will nevertheless attempt to get a clear picture on
 what is unique and specific about these (for now, four) parts, and only
 later try to split them up and build one structure, where no interdependences
 between the resulting parts are necessary anymore.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 that led me to the order we will see first will have to be revised.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to keep in mind that what seems to be definitions in the
 following list of concepts really is merely an attempt at summarizing entire
 philosophical debates on meanings, and thus do not contain any references.
 Please refer to the respective chapters for my attempts at clearing up
 what the terms actually mean.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The four provisional concepts I am interested in and the resulting partial
 questions for now are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Phenomenality:
\emph default
 The special way things are experienced by agents like us.
 Of course, for a first-person perspective to exist, we need subjectivity,
 so resolving that apparent circularity is an important part of our look
 at this subject.
 Phenomenality, however, also is what enables all the other bits and pieces
 we need in order to understand how consciousness happens.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I am not merely interested in how it works, but also in how it is that it
 got to work like that, and what the roots, causes and effects of consciousness
 are.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 What is phenomenality, and what entities or processes produce it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Qualia:
\emph default
 The particular non-subdivisable entities of atomic quality we perceive
 when we experience things.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is a particularly heated point of debate, I think Metzinger's qualification
 that this thesis touches in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Kinds-of-Qualia"

\end_inset

 is enlightening concerning why philosophers tend to disagree on whether
 such atomic entities exist or not.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This has been a passion of many philosophers since Lewis and Nagel; there
 is a pecularity about our experience in that it seems to consist of atomic
 smallest bits of experience which cannot be subdivided any further -- the
 particular way something seems to be irreducibly red or loud to us, for
 example.
 What is so special about these smallest entities of quality? Are they,
 can they really be atomic and irreducible? How are qualia conceptually
 definable?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Subjectivity:
\emph default
 The way we see everything from a first-person perspective.
 We experience both ourselves and our fellow humans as agents, and we believe
 that our fellow human beings experience themselves as persons as well.
 How is such a first-person perspective generated, and what else is included
 when someone speaks of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

myself
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Intentionality:
\emph default
 The world is given to us, and we relate to it.
 In introspection, our inner workings are given to us, as seen from a point
 of view which stands in a relation to these inner workings.
 How and why is that so? How come that we feel we are in direct metaphysical
 contact with (for example) an apple tree in the garden by means of some
 kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intentional arrow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mental focus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will dedicate a major chapter to each of these four parts, defining what
 exactly is puzzling about them, what different readings there were, and
 then looking at possible explanations for their origins and constitution.
 In doing so, we will also look at philosophers who worked with these concepts
 and attempt to find out what they really are, at least according to those
 philosophers' definitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When looking for a concise definition of the four big questions of what
 phenomenality, qualia, subjectivity and intentionality really are, many
 philosophers made proposals as to what they could be.
 I want to look at two of the most recent proposals, those of Dennett and
 Metzinger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, Metzinger digs deeper and develops traditional ideas in entirely
 new ways, while Dennett presents important counterpoints to these traditional
 views and has a more radically reductionist point of view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, I will also include the proposals of Marvin Minsky (a true
 pioneer of artificial intelligence research) in the chapter about subjectivity.
 Minsky is influenced partially by Dennett, but is a computer scientist
 and artificial intelligence researcher with a more pragmatic and solutions-orie
nted background.
 Thus he brings an interesting and fresh point of view into the debate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, all three of them have to stand up compared to more traditional
 views, thus I decided to include these in my summary as well:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For 
\emph on
phenomenality
\emph default
, Edmund Husserl's phenomenology can well be seen as the origin of the idea,
 and has followers to this very day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For 
\emph on
qualia
\emph default
, we will look at Clarence Irwing Lewis' introduction of the concept.
 Also, Thomas Nagel might not have named qualia as such, but his work certainly
 was an important multiplier of the idea that something is special about
 subjective experience, so we will briefly look at how he introduces the
 idea as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The traditional view in regards to the origin of 
\emph on
subjectivity
\emph default
 has to be the dualism of René Descartes, which is implicit in many theories
 to this very day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Concerning 
\emph on
intentionality
\emph default
, Franz Brentano greatly influenced Husserl by fleshing out the traditional
 idea of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

immanent objectivity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in our relationship to the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, I will add a short consolidatory chapter to all four sections,
 attempting to make sense of which ideas are the most promising for going
 forward from here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this lengthy introduction, allow me to start with the first major
 term of traditional phenomenology: phenomenality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Phenomenality"

\end_inset

Phenomenality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There seems to be something special about the way we see the world and ourselves
, something that is maybe ineffable, maybe inexplicable or mystical, but
 definitely hard to understand.
 There is something left if we explain intentionality and subjectivity,
 and subtract them from consciousness as a whole.
 I call what is left 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phenomenality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Dennett and Searle include more than Metzinger in the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intentionality,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 resulting in some parts of what I call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phenomenality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 being included in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intentionality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -- I will stay true to Metzinger's definition of intentionality here, as
 we will se in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Intentionality"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Phenomenality, and I think most philosophers agree on that, is the special
 nature in which we (and probably other conscious agents) see things, independen
t of what else there is to consciousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would argue that phenomenality in this sense is the most basic thing that
 is special about consciousness, and as such it 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 tempting to just attribute it as a special property to intentionality,
 or to say that what is special about phenomenality is nothing but that
 experience consists of qualia.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Since qualia are (for now) defined as the smallest possible atomic parts
 of experience, this seems entirely plausible.
 More on this in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Qualia"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will try to go another way here, showing what is special about phenomenality
 itself.
 Agreeing with Metzinger, many bits and pieces of the following chapters
 will refer to some event being phenomenal in nature, and here we will find
 out what I mean by that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Husserl: Systematic reflection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edmund Husserl prompted a radical paradigmatic shift with his works.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Husserl's works were mostly unpublished, at least during his lifetime.
 His work was published posthum starting 1950 as 
\emph on
Husserliana
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 He meant to do two things: Approach older concepts on what is mental in
 novel ways, and make subjective experience available for objective study
 through systematic reflection -- standing in Descartes' tradition and taking
 facts gained through introspection at face value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Husserl put great emphasis on intentionality as the prime carrier of phenomenali
ty.
 Unlike Martin Heidegger, who later put a greater emphasis on ontological
 consciousness independent of intentionality (and offering an explanation
 for the subconscious that intuitively might seem to be better, although
 as we will see it is not necessarily more correct), Husserl put the focus
 on how we might be able to describe our own phenomenal experience, and
 how events are perceived as being immediately given to our consciousness.
 Importantly, events are given immediately indeed, but occasionally only
 partially and inadequately so -- Husserl agrees that it is perfectly possible
 to misrepresent things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The immediate directedness is given through the three parts of any intentional
 act as follows:

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I already used this list in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 -- many thanks to Prof.
 E.
 Marbach for the great lectures and seminars, and the fruitful discussions
 that helped me better understand Husserl's approach.
 I hope I do Husserl's work justice in this thesis.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Immanent content, which is raw perceptive data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Intentional content, which is sense, the way the intentional object is intended
 (memory, fantasy, expectance, wish, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Intentional object, which is the thing the intentional act is directed at
 (in the case of perception, the actual object).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What really makes out phenomenality for Husserl is that all these parts
 have to be given for an event in question, otherwise it is not phenomenal.

Dennett's heterophenomenology is phenomenology as seen from a third-person
 perspective.
 He defines it like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
I have defended the hypothesis that there is a straightforward, conservative
 extension of objective science that handsomely covers the ground -- 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 the ground -- of human consciousness, doing justice to all the data without
 ever having to abandon the rules and constraints of the experimental method
 that have worked so well in the rest of science.
 This third-person methodology, dubbed heterophenomenology (phenomenology
 of 
\emph on
another
\emph default
 not oneself), is, I have claimed, the sound way to take the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 person point of view as seriously as it can be taken.

\begin_layout Standard
Essentially, Dennett defines heterophenomenology mostly by what it is not:
 It is not subjectivist, but intersubjective.
 It is not first-person pilot studies, but third-person scientific research.
 He claims that everything that would be phenomenology is intersubjectivizable,
 thus symbolic, and thus not ineffable.
 There is no interesting subsymbolic mental content, or at least, none that
 we could do proper science with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He does put his position into perspective:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
I suspect that when we claim to be just using our powers of inner 
\emph on
observation

\emph on

 -- and we are remarkably gullible theorizers, precisely because there is
 so little to

 and so much to pontificate about without fear of contradiction.
 [...] Am I saying we have absolutely no privileged access to our conscious
 experience? No, but I am saying that we tend to think we are much more
 immune to error than we are.

Ultimately, it comes down to the following: In heterophenomenology, phenomenolog
ical reports of individual agents are not to be taken at face value, but
 as theorist's fictions.
 Only after collecting and cataloguing them, looking for similarities and
 differences between different agent's fictions, can a researcher start
 attempting to explain the existence of these heterophenomenological reports.
 According to Dennett, that is all phenomenological reports are good for:
 They are but collections of data and pointers for later research into the
 true nature of how consciousness happens:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
We organize our data regarding these phenomena into theorist's fictions,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

intentional objects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in heterophenomenological worlds.
 Then the question of whether items thus portrayed exist as real objects,
 events, and states in the brain -- or in the soul, for that matter -- is
 an empirical matter to investigate.
 If suitable real candidates are uncovered, we can identify them as the
 long-sought referents on the subject's terms; if not, we will have to explain
 why it seems to subjects that these items exist.

Notably, for Dennett, heterophenomenology (unlike his notion of traditional

Metzinger: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Multilevel constraints
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metzinger proposes a catalogue of conditions that he calls 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

multilevel constraints
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in order to define what makes the phenomenal experience of consciousness
 possible and necessary if they apply to any given system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any system that satisfies those conditions necessarily has to be conscious
 -- and the brain is just one such system, even though it is the only one
 we know to date.
 He does not explicitly legitimate calling them 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

constraints.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This nomenclature is consistent with his theory however once we realize
 that they are not primarily about what a system has to be able to do, but
 importantly also about what boundaries the system's capabilities need to
 have, in order for the system to be truly conscious.
 Particularly the transparency constraint that we will meet in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Transparency"

\end_inset

 might well have been a prime motivation for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constraints are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

multilevel
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in that Metzinger attempts to capture all the important levels of description
 he considers to be important for consciousness research for each of them.

 These include the phenomenological level, the representationalist level,
 the informational-computational level, the functional level and finally
 the physical-neurobiological level.
 I will further explore these levels and Metzinger's use of the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I cannot discuss all those levels for each constraint, but I will try to
 explain each constraint individually nevertheless, glossing over the different
 levels and starting each constraint's discussion with a quote from Metzinger's
 book,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In fact, I will stay so close to his argumentation overall that I will occasiona

\end_layout

 and close with a very short synopsis of how a system can satisfy the constraint
 in question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will not argue for the individual constraints here, as that would mostly
 be merely attempting to duplicate Metzinger's fine work.
 We will encounter some of the constraints again later in this thesis however,
 in other contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Important in the context of answering the question what phenomenality is
 however is the chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Levels-of-Consciousness"

\end_inset

, where we will see how Metzinger uses these constraints in order to differentia
te between different levels of phenomenal experience, and how he shows that
 phenomenality is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, however, I want to criticize Metzinger's choice of names, and then
 introduce three other concepts that Metzinger improves our understanding
 of: Introspection, how consciousness can not be anything but a process,
 and Metzinger's concept of local supervenience.

Metzinger's choice of names
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I adopted Metzinger's numbering and choice of names for all of his constraints.
 This does at first sight make it unnecessarily hard to understand what
 exactly he means by some of those names, and my list of Metzinger's constraints
 in this chapter can also be seen as an attempt to translate the concepts
 he nominates into a more common philosophical vocabulary.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 and my thesis on the basis of unknown nomenclature and words that do not
 appear to be English.
 Metzinger being German does explain, but not necessarily justify his strange
 choice of constraint names.
 However, I believe that when introducing novel concepts, it makes sense
 to name these with novel words as well -- and, that once they are named,
 it makes sense to keep those names.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, I thought that the linguistic turn stopped our desparate clinging
 to words and nomenclature, and opened our minds for appreciation of concepts
 however they are named.
 In this spirit, I kept Metzinger's nomenclature for his constraints.

The concept of

 can be analyzed as a three-place relationship between representanda and
 representata with regard to an individual system: Representation is a process
 which achieves the internal depiction of a representandum by generating
 an internal state, which functions as a representatum [...].
 The representandum is the 
\emph on
object
\emph default
 of representation.
 The representatum is the concrete internal 
\emph on
state
\emph default
 carrying information related to this object.
 Representation is a

 by which the system as a whole generates this state.

 Furthermore, not all entities in the world necessarily have a representation
 -- As we will see in chapter

, there are presentata just like representata.

 is.

 For now, it is important to realize that this presentational content is
 what drives the processes which form mental states in the first place:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Presentational content will always be an important element of any such explanati

Local supervenience

\begin_layout Standard
Local supervenience in humans, the way Metzinger uses it, is defined by
 the content supervening on only some brain centers and not the entire brain,
 while being at least partially independent from the environment.
 The first time Metzinger mentions the concept is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
First, for phenomenal content the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

principle of local supervenience
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 holds: 
\emph on
phenomenal
\emph default
 content is determined by internal and contemporaneous properties of the
 conscious system, for example, by properties of its brain.
 For 
\emph on
intentional
\emph default
 content (i.e., 
\emph on
representational
\emph default
 content as more traditionally conceived) this does not have to be true:
 
\emph on
What
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
if
\emph default
 it actually represents may change with what actually exists in the environment.
 At the same time the phenomenal content, how things subjectively 
\emph on
feel
\emph default
 to you, may stay invariant, as does your brain state.

Phenomenal states are in a causal two-way relationship with the brain states
 they supervene on: The processes that contain the abstract conceptual content
 influence the brain states they supervene on, because the phenomenal states
 are realized in these brain states.
 The brain states on the other hand influence the abstract conceptual content,
 because the processes are executed by means of changing physical states
 in the brain.

Metzinger is talking about global availability of information for conscious
 processes in a phenomenally experiencing system.
 The information is 
\emph on
globally
\emph default
 available because every part of consciousness has access to them.
 According to Metzinger, there are three basic kinds of global availability:

Global availability for deliberately guided attention: In order to inspect
 things more in-depth, we can guide our attention towards certain aspects
 of ourselves or our environment.

Global availability for cognitive reference: We can think about things,
 we can form mental concepts of them, we can put them into relations with
 past experiences or plan actions involving them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Global availability for control of action: We can catch incoming balls,
 push buttons when stimuli occur, and also can act according to plans we
 have formed beforehand (which are then globally available as well).

In addition to the above, Metzinger also mentions speech control, autobiographic

 -- all of which are merely subcategories of the three more basic kinds
 however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every such kind of global availability is likely to have different neural
 correlates, but their whole is experienced as embedded into one complete
 world model and available to processes of consciousness anyway.
 The world model is all there is for a conscious mind, and its boundaries
 are the boundaries of the agent's reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metzinger notes that important points about global availability are the
 following: flexibility, selectivity of content, and a certain degree of
 autonomy.

The thus specified global availability enables the large number of specialized
 modules of our brain to interact with those phenomenal states that are
 globally available.
 Vice versa, it provides an interface to many modules for new such phenomenal
 states that enter the system's world model.
 This allows the system to react flexibly and quickly to new threats and
 challenges from its environment.

 A system that does not have a concept of Now is not in a present, and consequen
tly cannot produce a phenomenal experience with a concept of past or future
 presents, nor is it able to produce a phenomenal experience of a concept
 of coherence at all.
\end_layout

Furthermore, the concept of Now is needed for the experience of presentation;
 only if we can experience something as being presented right now we can
 experience it as being presented at all.
 Metzinger thus also calls this the

presentationality constraint.

\begin_layout Quote
If events are not only represented as being in temporal succession but are
 integrated into temporal figures [...], then a present emerges, because these
 events are now internally connected.
 They are not isolated atoms anymore, because they form a context for each
 other.
 [...] something like object formation takes place in which isolated events
 are integrated into a Now.
 One can describe the emergence of this Now as a process of segmentation
 that separates a vivid temporal object from a temporal background that
 is only weakly structured.
 This can, for instance, happen if we do not experience a musical motive
 as a sequence of isolated sound events, but as a holistic temporal figure.
 A psychological moment is not an extensionless point, but for beings like
 us it possesses a culturally invariant duration of, maximally, three seconds.

Pöppel (1994) has argued that two kinds of perceptual moment can be distinguishe
d.
 The first, 
\noun on
primordial events
\noun default
, which last for a fraction of a second, serve in effect as a `linking activity,
' to integrate or bind spatially distributed information in the brain between
 and within different modalities.
 This facilitates the integration of spatially-distributed sensory information
 as primordial events, e.g., the perception of an object in which visual input,
 auditory input and information from other modalities are integrated into
 a coherent percept.
 The second kind, the perceptual moment with an outer range of 2-3 seconds,
 serves to link these primordial events into a coherent unity, which, he
 argues forms the basis of our concept of the present.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
According to Pöppel, perceptual moments in the 2-3 second range involve
 what he terms 
\noun on
temporal binding
\noun default
 (as opposed to the binding spatially-distributed activities).
 He proposes that it is the perceptual moment of approximately 2-3 seconds
 to which the concept of the present (our experience of now) can be traced.

This is the generalized case of constraint 1, global availability.
 If there are facets of our world model that are globally available, these
 facets have to be perceived as something global.
 The entirety of all those facets that are perceived as something global

 same, all throughout all modalities.

This means that these facets must be perceived as being parts of one global

 reasonable to assume that agents even in non-pathological cases experience
 not just one, but several world models, and are able to switch between
 them as needed (for example, a rational and a supernatural world model).
 This does not invalidate Metzinger's constraint 3 however, as in non-pathologic

 one coherent whole world model.

For convolved holism to be possible at all, it is necessary that we have
 one all-encompassing world model, and we experience all those parts and
 wholes as being in the phenomenal Now.
 Thus constraints 2 and 3 are prerequisites for convolved holism -- one
 could even say that convolved holism is a natural extension of the coherent
 global state.
 On the other hand, it is perfectly thinkable for a system to have a whole
 world model that is not partitioned at all, not even into the self-world
 distinction which is so important for us humans, leading to

The same set of part-whole relations of course applies to causal contexts

 in those system's perceptions of themselves -- so in other words, introspection

 If we have a phenomenal, temporal Now, we can easily perceive of more Nows

 This must not necessarily be the case for a system, but if it is, it allows

The subjective experience of time is dependent on attention and representational
 content, but the core issue with time perception seems to be duration,
 permanence, the transtemporal identity of objects for the system.
 Everything else we experience is always perceived as being a property of
 such experientally presented, dynamical objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not easy to form a concept of the perception of dynamic time beyond
 this.
 Steps leading to a lower-level representational explanation of this concept
 would include finding how events are individuated, then finding how patterns
 and sequences of such events are formed.
 Already those two steps are controversial however, and Metzinger surrenders
 when faced with the aforementioned transtemporal identity problem.

Metzinger points out that this is among the most interesting phenomena of
 phenomenology, and I tend to agree.
 Perspectivalness, the specific nature of how our perception is always from
 a conscious and self-aware first-person point of view, was among the chief
 things that made me read Metzinger's work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earlier, I had been disappointed concerning what exactly subjectivity is
 while reading Dennett.
 He merely glosses over the functional aspect of this interesting point
 (as we will see in chapter

), and does not offer a real solution to the problems it poses.

The phenomenology of being someone, of consciously experienced selfhood,
 is the first explicit level of subjectivity -- it is potentially both cognitive

 This is what Metzinger's theory on the phenomenal self-model (PSM, see

 and in particular chapter

 There is an epistemic asymmetry that only appears on this level of representati

 to explain why it is epistemically irreducible

 The special and hitherto somewhat mysterious fact that the phenomenal character

\begin_layout Quote
Transparency in this sense is a property of active mental representations
 already satisfying the minimally sufficient constraints for conscious experienc
e to occur.
 For instance, phenomenally transparent representations are always activated
 within a virtual window of presence and integrated into a unified global
 model of the world.
 The second defining characteristic postulates that what makes them transparent
 is the 
\emph on
attentional unavailability of earlier processing

Metzinger's definition of transparency represents a novel approach.
 According to the standard definition, vehicle properties of certain mental
 states are not available for introspection whereas content properties are.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Of course, what exactly constitutes these vehicle and content properties
 is a matter of definition as well.
 Trivially, in this context, vehicle properties are everything physical,
 while content properties are everything mental.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, as Metzinger points out, there clearly are cases in which what
 formerly were vehicle properties (not physical vehicle properties, but
 for example thoughts or emotions) can become opaque and are available for
 introspection as well.
 There are different degrees of transparency according to how much of those
 vehicle properties is currently available for introspection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, vehicle and content are not as easily distinguishable as it
 seems, but are rather different aspects of the same ongoing process --
 so attempting to split them apart bears 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

subtle residues of Cartesian dualism

, which makes definitions of transparency using the terms of vehicle and
 content less desirable.

for every kind of phenomenal content in humans there will be at least one

 Metzinger, in addition to these two, also talks about how phenomenal transparen
cy is not equivalent to the kinds of transparency implemented in transparent
 technical systems like proxy servers or email servers on the internet.
 Those systems have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 not phenomenal and thus -- at least until this changes -- not interesting

Transparency is a phenomenological concept, not an epistemological notion.
 So it is possible to be wrong about one's own mental contents; In fact,
 that happens rather often in pathological cases.
 It's however not possible to be aware of all of one's own processes when
 thinking about one's own consciousness, exactly because the core processes
 are hidden from introspection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Phenomenal transparency is subsymbolic and used as a concept in philosophical
 neurophenomenology, not as a part of formal semantics.
 As such it can exist in nonlinguistic creatures and is not a property of
 context nor referential in an ontological sense.
 Any conscious being can have (and necessarily has, because transparency
 will be shown to be a prerequisite for phenomenality in chapter

\begin_layout Standard
Transparency, for a system that employs it, seems to imply the existence
 of the entities represented.
 This leads to the conclusion that a naive realism concerning these entities

 phenomenal realism is the way we experience the world.
 We do not see what we are looking through, the medium that the experience
 takes place in is indetectable for introspective access.

 For color perception, the intensity dimension is brightness, for sound,
 it is loudness -- but it always seems to be the most fundamental phenomenal
 dimension associated with a certain perception, and there is no simple
 sensory content that does

 Metzinger calls it the sensory content's

In some cases, it is even possible for us to experience intensity without
 associated dimensions.
 For color, that would be a human experiencing pure brightness without hue
 and saturation -- Metzinger refers to Ganzfeld experiments,

What is not possible, however, is that there is no analogue representation
 of a certain stimulus, due to biological reasons: Stimuli are perceived
 through physical sensors that detect certain modal qualities along with
 their intensities.
 Not detecting something (for example, no light in a dark room) merely has
 the associated sensors detect an intensity of nearly zero (below the lowest
 detectable threshold).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since intensity directly infers signal strength, it is highly adaptive for
 an organism to make those detected intensities globally available, too,
 and some qualities (like pain) are able to fixate the system's attention
 on certain specific aspects of its world model:

However, as Metzinger points out, the entire area in question appears as
 directly given, it can well be called atomic itself, since it appears not
 to be further divisible.
 As soon as we start thinking about subregions, the concept of those subregions
 starts forming (they are relative to the curently employed representational
 architecture), but before that, there just is the entirely transparent
 concept of the simple, ultrasmooth, representationally atomic, one-color
 surface.

This partially revolutionizes the concept of causal roles of sensory input.
 Due to the fact that we need to represent entities as wholes because otherwise
 we would necessarily represent their parts as well, in order for any perception
 (or more precise, any representational state) to have a causal role at
 all, it has to be homogenous.

The underlying issue is that artificial systems do not require any teleofunction
alist properties; their goals and ideals (or rather, the corresponding represent
ative mental states) do not necessarily have to make sense.
 Only evolution ensures that the development of goal states which are detrimenta
l to an organism's reproduction do not enter the common gene pool of that
 species.
 In other words, goal states in real intelligence do generally make sense.
\begin_inset Foot

This is true at least most of the time and if seen in a bigger context.
 Of course, the rapid secondary and tertiary evolution (through the replication
 of memes and temes) that we are now going through (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) makes some of the goal states that were a result of genetic evolution
 occasionally outdated.
 Furthermore, things that are not detrimental (as opposed to necessarily
 beneficial) to a species' survival can also make it into the gene pool.
\end_layout

 Emotions, then, are the expression of those goal states in human beings.
 Being attracted to a member of the opposite sex (as a trivial example)
 is beneficial for reproduction.

I want to distance myself from naturalistic fallacies and homophobic readings
 of this example.
 Being attracted to the opposite sex being beneficial for reproduction does
 not make being attracted to your own sex any less probable or desirable
 from a moral or ethical point of view.
 Genetic dispositions to that end will however necessarily always remain
 in the minority, as individuals that exhibit them are less likely to reproduce.

Similar arguments apply to consciousness and phenomenal states in general,
 although the benefits always have to be weighed up (and brutally and remorseles
sly 
\emph on
are
\emph default
 weighed up in evolutionary processes) against their downsides, like the
 larger brain that makes human childbirth more stressful (and potentially
 lethal for both mother and child) than that of other animals.
 If large brains thus are to prevail, they need to have other benefits that
 weigh up those shortcomings, or they will not stand up to evolutionary
 pressure.
 And of course, there is such a benefit: Consciousness increases the odds
 of survival of a particular species, because it increases flexibility and
 adaptivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Consciousness, first, is an instrument to generate successful behavior;
 like the nervous system itself it is a device that evolved for motor control
 and sensorimotor integration.
 Different forms of phenomenal content are answers to different problems
 which organisms were confronted with in the course of their evolution.
 Color vision solves another class of problems than the conscious experience
 of one's own emotion, because it makes another kind of information available
 for flexible control of action.

Every resultant is either a sum or a difference of the co-operant forces;
 their sum, when their directions are the same -- their difference, when
 their directions are contrary.
 Further, every resultant is clearly traceable in its components, because
 these are homogeneous and commensurable.
 It is otherwise with emergents, when, instead of adding measurable motion
 to measurable motion, or things of one kind to other individuals of their
 kind, there is a co-operation of things of unlike kinds.
 The emergent is unlike its components insofar as these are incommensurable,
 and it cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference.

 And there is no need to be afraid of solutions that appear to be counter-intuit

Ineffability then comes naturally with the combination of at least perspectivaln

 Other constraints (like global availability, activation within a window

I am cautious here because while Metzinger does explicitly talk about levels
 of consciousness with the definitions (see chapter

\end_layout

 that the extent to which a system's states (or rather, processes) are experienc

 constraints it satisfies.

Considering how much space I gave each of the three different points of

 I think that he offers the first proper explanation of consciousness in
 general (despite Dennett in

 promising to do so 12 years earlier), and phenomenality in particular.

\begin_layout Quote
Lone-wolf autophenomenology, in which the subject and experimenter are one

However, I am not sure if Dennett's position is really that different from
 Husserl's with respect to what is science and what is not.
 Maybe Heidegger's continuation of Husserl's theories, putting significantly
 more focus on what he considers to be a fact, that phenomenality is a subjectiv
e phenomenon, would fall victim to the above argumentation of Dennett's.
 Husserl, however, may even agree with Dennett:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
It is absolutely clear; scientific conclusions regarding phenomena are not
 feasible after phenomenologic reduction, in particular if we conceptually
 define those phenomena as absolutely distinct and unique.
 Only if we enter the empirical-psychological sphere, if we look at the
 phenomena as experiences of an experiencing self that is in an interrelation
 with nature, can we conceptualize [what scientific conclusions we can reach]
 in a similar way to how psychologists do it in experimental practice.

Thus, individual phenomenal experiences only gain a scientific meaning if
 they are also looked at in the context that the subject experiencing them
 was in.
 Furthermore, it is important to recognize that empirical research includes
 not only individual, distinct and unique such phenomenal experiences, but
 rather an entire class of them, preferrably from multiple subjects or at
 least from the same subject reproducibly experienced.

Husserl also does not presuppose infallibility of phenomenal experience:

\begin_layout Quote
What the referenced object actually is is not topic of our research; it

 be.

In light of these passages from Husserl, I am uncertain as to what precisely
 it is that so radically distinguishes heterophenomenology from phenomenology.
 Both Dennett and Husserl agree that we have some (more or less limited)
 privileged access to our mental states.
 They further agree that proper scientific research can only be performed
 from a third-person, intersubjective point of view.
 Only if we stop taking phenomenological accounts at face value, and start
 forming theories that attempt to explain what it is that makes agents enjoy
 the particular phenomenal experiences that they do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering that neither of them actually offers more insight into what
 phenomenal experience itself is however, I lay this issue aside, and for
 the remainder of this thesis focus on Metzinger's more thorough theory
 of the genesis of phenomenality.

 to model how agents manage to make autophenomenological reports

 based upon their particular expertise and proclivities.

 [...] [but] each can potentially contribute to the direction the play takes.
 In this sense the global workspace resembles more a deliberative body than
 an audience.

Minsky however goes on to criticize just the complete global availability
 that Metzinger suggests:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
However, this raises several questions about the extent to which different
 resources can speak the same language, and [I] argue that different resources
 will need to use multiple levels of representations and different short-term
 memory systems to keep track of various kinds of contexts.
 Besides, if each specialist could broadcast signals to all the rest, the
 workspace would become so noisy that the system would need to develop ways
 to restrict the amount of communication.

Global availability should also not be overrated:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
How could such machines [such as individually unique human brains] work
 reliably, in spite of so much variety [in terms of environmental and self-model
ing]? To explain this, quite a few thinkers have argued that our brains
 must be based on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

holistic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 principles, according to which every fragment of process or knowledge is
 “globally distributed” (in some unknown way) so that the system's behavior
 would still be the same in spite of the loss of some of its parts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
However, [I] suggest that we do not need any such magical tricks -- because
 we have so many different ways to accomplish any type of job.
 Also, it makes sense to suppose that many parts of our brains evolved as
 ways to correct (or to suppress) the effects of defects in other parts.

\begin_layout Standard
So, while it certainly may 
\emph on
seem
\emph default
 as if we had everything globally available, what in fact happens is that
 sensory inputs are processed in parallel by a wide variety of processes,
 and many brain centers (which Minsky calls “critics” and “selectors”) have
 access to parts of these processes and can potentially process them further.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 is neither magical nor entirely global.
 Rather, which brain centers have access to what processes is stored in
 the dynamical hardware

 of the brain.
 I do not mean to claim that domain borders between different processes
 cannot be crossed -- quite the opposite, that possibility is indeed (according
 to Metzinger) one of the prime advantages of our kind of consciousness.
 Yet, these domain borders can only be crossed in certain ways that are
 predetermined in the same dynamical hardware that implements the processes
 themselves.

 seems to be quite straightforward.
 The constraint describes a first-person point of view which starts out
 with a proto self-model which is nonconceptual, happens before cognitive

 The complete constraint then consists of a nonconceptual prereflexive proto
 self-consciousness, a PSM

 Given a prereflexive proto self-model, we can conclude that a complete
 self-model has to arise from the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, such a proto self-consciousness is anything but trivial, and not
 that straightforward after all.
 What exactly is the entity that we are prereflexively, nonconceptually,
 aware of? It cannot be a self-model, as that would mean that it would require
 itself in an infinite regress.
 There is some basic form of perspectivalness which is given for all of
 today's known conscious systems; They are all spatially confined to a relativel
y small area, and perceive their entire surroundings via a single viewpoint.
 Is there more to perspectivalness than that? Can that be enough to give
 rise to a complete PSM later on?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finding this prereflexive proto self-model will require empirical experiments
 with postbiotic or artificial systems to truly advance in this matter,
 as today very little about it is known.

 In the thought experiment, Davidson is standing near a tree in a swamp
 during a thunderstorm.
 When lightning strikes the tree, Davidson is disintegrated, and by pure
 coincidence the tree is turned into an exact physical replica of Davidson
 (including brain with current neural state etc.).

This does bear some similarities to the paradox of the ship of Theseus,
 but also striking differences.
 Two things are very different: The timespan over which the transformation
 happens, and the location in which it happens.
 The ship of Theseus is transformed over a longer period of time, while
 the swampman is transformed instantaneously and spontaneously.
 The location of the new ship of Theseus is the same as the old one was,
 while the swampman stands in a different spot than Davidson did.
 However, there are striking resemblances as well, because in both thought
 experiments, an exact physical replication is created while the original
 is destroyed, and the question is what traits that replication shares with
 the original.
 It all comes down to what transtemporal aspects the traits in question
 have of course, and that is rarely well-defined.

The aim of this thought experiment is showing that an exact replica of a

 it might even have the exact same kind of phenomenality.
 Yet it lacks the original Davidson's intentional content.
 Metzinger writes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
[...] for instance, it has many false memories about its own history be they
 as conscious as they may.
 The active phenomenal representations in Swampman's brain would [...] 
\emph on

 satisfy the adaptivity constraint, because these states would have the
 wrong kind of history.
 They did not originate from a process of millions of years of evolution.
 [...] It would [...] still be consciousness in a weaker sense, because it does
 not satisfy the adaptivity constraint [...].

 built-in, only attached by means of being passed down through the generations.
 All the things we take as signs of proper intelligence beyond basic empathy
 (including being able to play chess, talking with each other in a common
 language, reading and writing) do not have this kind of proper, system-internal
 history.
 They were introduced from the outside, from our parents and teachers, our
 environment, our experiences.
 And that is the very thing Metzinger tells us is what is wrong with a hypotheti
cal postbiotic intelligence -- even if it were built from actual organic
 tissue, and even if it had gone through an evolutionary process of its
 own:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
[...] it would still follow that these postbiotic phenomenal systems would
 only be conscious in a slightly weaker sense than human beings, because
 human beings were necessary to trigger the second-level evolutionary process
 from which these beings were able to develop their own phenomenal dynamics.
 From a human perspective, just like Swampman, they might not possess the
 right kind of history to count as maximally conscious agents.

A weaker adaptivity constraint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Metzinger formulated his adaptivity constraint, he seems to have been
 driven by mainly one of his background assumptions, one that he explicitly
 states at the very beginning of his book: Teleofunctionalism.

 He introduces his commitment like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
[...] representata have been specified by an additional 
\emph on
teleological
\emph default
 criterion: an internal state 
\emph on
X
\emph default
 represents a part of the world 
\emph on
Y for
\emph default
 a system 
\emph on
S
\emph default
.
 This means that the respective physical state within the system only possesses
 its representational content in the context of the history, the goals,
 and the behavioural possibilities of this particular system.
 This context, for instance, can be of social or evolutionary nature.
 [...] It is for this reason that we can always look at mental states with
 representational content as instruments or weapons.
 If one analyzes active mental representata as internal tools, which are
 currently used by certain systems in order to achieve certain goals, then
 one has become a teleofunctionalist or a teleorepresentationalist.

 he constructed a theory that lacks scientific foundation and appears to
 be of mostly speculative nature, as all theories involving metaphysical
 and non-observable entities necessarily do).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But when Metzinger uses it, it translates to the assumption that the things
 our brains do

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As a matter of fact, he is not only talking about our brains, but all organic

 must be good for something -- because if they were not, they would not
 have been a fitness criterion for evolution, and consequently would not
 have survived the last few million years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is consistent with scientific findings.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Even if we have to ignore for now that teleological explanations are not
 necessary for every bit of functionality, as some might only have been
 not detrimental to survival, as opposed to being strictly beneficial.
 A well-known example is the appendix -- it does have a function and must
 once have been necessary for survival, but no longer is, but nevertheless
 it also is not detrimental to our survival.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 I do not agree with Metzinger's assumption that million years of evolution
 are a necessary prerequisite for something being a fitness criterion however,
 nor do I agree with the assumption that merely because a fit system has
 been duplicated (as Davidson's Swampman was, see chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Proto self-model"

\end_inset

) it suddenly loses some kind of metaphysical fitness 
\emph on
pre

condition.
 However, this is exactly what Metzinger's reading of the adaptivity constraint
 presupposes: That there is some secret ingredient to proper intentionality
 after all, a ghost in the machine reminiscent of dualist theories despite
 all our efforts to banish it.
\begin_inset Foot

I do not deny the importance of evolution for today's kind of intelligence.
 It certainly seems to have been essential, both as a driving force and
 a shaping constraint.
 However, even from a purely teleofunctionalist point of view, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

proper history

 form of Metzinger's adaptivity constraint.
 While an organism may pursue the goals of its ancestors, while this may
 be important for all of today's biological sentient systems (including
 humans), it is not necessary for other, as of yet unknown, kinds of proper

Of course, the very notion of representata being

 His normative definition of good representata is:

\begin_layout Quote
Phenomenal representata are

 Husserl merely did not attempt to look behind what is introspectively accessibl

 when we do not even know what the explanandum itself is.
 Neither did he attempt to form an ontological theory, but rather an epistemolog

 Opinions on what exactly this structure is, and how to best research it,
 differ widely.
 What is common to most notions of qualia is that they are supposed to be
 among the most basic available bits of epistemic knowledge concerning conscousn
ess, and that they seem to be indivisible from a first-person point of view.

 a forest.
 Dennett makes an example of the plethora of qualia we can experience and

 pattern of wonderful intricacy.
 The windowpane is made of old glass, and has a scarcely detectable wrinkle
 line in it, and as I rocked back and forth [in my rocking chair], this
 imperfection in the glass caused a wave of synchronized wiggles to march
 back and forth across the delta of branches, a regular motion superimposed
 with remarkable vividness on the more chaotic shimmer of the twigs and
 branches in the breeze.

Lewis: Introducing qualia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clarence Irving Lewis introduced qualia as maximally simple forms of sensory
 content like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
In any presentation, this content is either a specific quale (such as the
 immediacy of redness or loudness) or something analyzable into a complex
 of such.
 The presentation as an event is, of course, unique, but the qualia which
 make it up are not.
 They are recognizable from one to another experience.
 [...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
What any concept denotes -- or any adjective such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

red
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

round
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -- is something more complex than an identifiable sense-quale.
 In particular, the object of the concept must always have a time-span which
 extends beyond the specious present; this is essential to the cognitive
 significance of concepts.
 The qualia of sense as something given do not, in the nature of the case,
 have such temporal spread.
 Moreover, such qualia, though repeatable in experience and intrinsically
 recognizable, have no names.
 They are fundamentally different from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

universals
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of logic and of traditional problems concerning these.

Qualia are recognizable and thus also categorizable -- but they are not
 determinate concepts just yet.
 There is however a correlation between qualia as categorizable perceptual
 content and determinate concepts.
 That correlation is both potentially different from one situation to the
 next (when different aspects of a concept are in focus) and different from
 one person to another, but qualia are reliably graspable in such determinate
 concepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Epistemically, it is not possible to be mistaken about qualia; we always
 know which qualia we experience.
 However, it is possible that the concepts to which the experienced qualia
 relate are wrong, and (while part of our world model), not part of the
 external world.

 For instance, taking his most prominent example, we face serious problems
 when we attempt to imagine what it is like to be a bat:

\begin_layout Quote
In so far as I can imagine this (which is not very far), it tells me only
 what it would be like for me to behave as a bat behaves.
 But that is not the question.
 I want to know what it is like for a bat to be a bat.
 Yet if I try to imagine this, I am restricted to the resources of my own
 mind, and those resources are inadequate to the task.
 I cannot perform it either by imagining additions to my present experience,
 or by imagining segments gradually subtracted from it, or by imagining
 some combination of additions, subtractions, and modifications.

 things can get us any closer to how that specificially first-person way
 of experiencing things happens.
 This must be explainable on a functional level, as well as by neurophysiology
 (which, as Nagel himself admitted, faces no such obstacles).
 Nevertheless, we are faced with some obstacles right now, because in our

 sometimes we even seem to have experienced them differently to how they
 actually and observably happened, right after the fact, or even seemingly
 in the act of perceiving them.
 One of the many examples Dennett puts forward is how subjects seem to experienc
e taps within 1 to 3 seconds, in only three distinct places (wrist, elbow
 and upper arm) on one of their arms, as if a small animal was steadily
 crawling up that arm:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The astonishing effect is that the taps seem to the subjects to travel in
 regular sequence over equidistant points up the arm -- as if a little animal
 were hopping along the arm.
 Now, at first one feels like asking 
\emph on
how did the brain know
\emph default
 that after the five taps on the wrist, there were going to be some taps
 near the elbow? The subjects experience the

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of the taps from the wrist beginning with the second tap, yet in catch

 all five wrist taps at the wrist in the expected manner.

 in that it rewrites history all the time: This theory suggests that processes
 in the brain rewrite memories after the experience itself has happened,
 altering not the experience itself, but our memories of it.
 So, if we have wrong memories of happenings in the past, we had correct
 memories once, but they changed over time.

Stalinesque revisions:

 Like the Stalin government misrepresented facts through the censored media
 to its populace, complete with false evidence and elaborate productions,
 this explanation changes things as they happen: We experience worldly contents
 that have been altered by lower-level brain processes already.
 So, if we have wrong memories of happenings in the past, it is not because
 the memories are misrepresentations of past experience, but because that
 past experience already was factually wrong.

Mental content appears to be formed by ever-changing physical representations
 where the current form of the vehicle is actually part of and forms the

 Metzinger agrees with Dennett on this.
 For example, in

This alteration of the physical basis goes even further, because the brain
 actively remodels neuron connections in processes like learning or forming

According to Dennett's interpretation of Descartes (see

Dennett continues to explore some consequences that seem oddly inconsistent
 at first sight, but are perfectly rational from a multiple drafts point
 of view.
 Looking at these processes as a continuous stream from sensory input to
 eventual dissolving (or storage in long-term memory), he points out:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Probing this stream at different places and times produces different effects,
 precipates different narratives from the subject.
 If one delays the probe too long [...], the result is apt to be no narrative
 left at all -- or else a narrative that has been digested or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

rationally reconstructed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 until it has no integrity.
 If one probes 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

too early,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 one might gather data on how early a particular discrimination is achieved
 by the brain, but at the cost of diverting what would otherwise have been
 the normal progression of the multiple stream.
 Most important, the Multiple Drafts model avoids the tempting mistake of
 supposing that there must be a single narrative [...] that is canonical --
 that is the 
\emph on
actual
\emph default
 stream of consciousness of the subject.

 and that timings for example for processing of visual inputs can be found
 with experiments.
 Several different kinds of judgements that a subject makes can be distinguished
, among them 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the mere onset of stimulus, then location, then shape, later color (in a

 And all those judgements do not necessarily come together somewhere in
 one locus for a final review (although they can, in memory, where they

 Rather, they are rather directly available for further processing and,

 since while there can be a version that is stored in long-term memory,
 earlier probings (when more parallel processes are still running) usually
 yield more information about the specific nature of the running processes,
 and some mental content is at that time phenomenally perceived as being
 in the center of attention.

 directly.

Disqualifying qualia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dennett starts with the observations that led him to his multiple drafts
 theory, and adds some further layers, before he attempts to disqualify
 the concept of qualia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important point of Dennett's theory regarding qualia is that feature
 detectors which make us experience something as “blue” or “bitter” co-evolved
 with the features they detect.
 Color vision evolved because there were features distinguishable by color.
 More precisely, it evolved because color happens to be a concept that is
 able to interpret random side features of chemical compositions of certain
 aspects of our ancient predecessor's surroundings, and able to do that
 in a way that is beneficial for an individual's survival -- in that it
 makes the individual able to draw distinctions that happen to correlate
 with (what is now known as) color differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So color vision evolved because there were features distinguishable by color,
 and vice versa, starting small and growing from there - yet the fact that
 a butterfly's wings have the same blue hue as cobalt is mere coincidence.
 “Why is the sky blue? Because apples are red and grapes are purple, not
 the other way around.”

 And what property is that? It's hard to say, but this should not embarass
 us, because we can say why it's hard to say.
 The best we can do, practically, when asked what surface properties we
 detect with color vision, is to say, uninformatively, that we detect the
 properties we detect.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 -- this nomenclature stresses the difference between neuroanatomy and experienc
e, between information and qualia.
 Qualia (which Dennett does not support) cannot be divided into mechanical
 parts, while mere information can be split up without losing anything.
 Dennett believes that Qualia do not exist insofar as that there are no
 such irreducible basic entities of experience.

To prove that these differences between the individual experiences of different
 people are explicable in their entirety, Dennett proposes another thought

 in the meantime.
 He claims that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

 and what it is like to be us.

Metzinger, like Dennett, does not believe that the classical concept of

 phenomenal experiences -- do not exist.”

For Metzinger, the traditional notion of qualia is that they are are maximally
 simple (atomic) subjective universals, recognizable from one experiential

 core of all subjective states.
 Judgements about qualia cannot be false, because they are defined through
 the subjective determination that judges them.

Metzinger wants to show that there is no such thing as `always implied most

 To that end, he attempts to find out how we could go about individuating
 these most simple forms in the first place -- and already this stage of
 the project fails.

What Raffman has shown is the existence of a shallow level in subjective

 for memory nor for cognitive access in general.
 Outside of the phenomenal “Now” there is no type of subjective access to
 this level of content.
 However, we are, nevertheless, confronted with a disambiguated and maximally
 determinate form of phenomenal content.

So the problem precisely does not consist in that the very special content

 The problem consists in the fact of beings with our psychological structure

However, unlike Dennett, Metzinger still calls his followup concept (or

 red) exist

According to Metzinger, we can easily form a concept of a pure color.
 It will of course include a range of colors that are all classified as

Metzinger considers the discussion about qualia to date, and notices that
 there are some completely different readings of the term that are often
 used interchangeably.
 He offers the following distinction, according to the number of constraints
 they satisfy in descending order:

 in discrimination tasks, but not available for cognition.

\begin_layout Itemize
Metzinger qualia: Attentionally available, but ineffable and not accessible
 to cognition, as well as not available for motor output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, there is a decline in as how real events are perceived from one
 to the next of these kinds of qualia -- Raffman qualia are perceived as
 being less real than Lewis qualia, and Metzinger qualia are perceived as
 being even less real than Raffman qualia.
 Nevertheless, there are examples for all three kinds; two of them we have
 seen in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, where a pure red would be a Lewis quale, while a a non-pure color would
 be a Raffman quale.
 Examples of Metzinger qualia (that would be immediately destroyed if the
 subject were to report them, since that would require making them available
 for motor control) are “highly abstract forms of consciously experienced
 mental content, as they sometimes appear in the minds of mathematicians
 and philosophers.”

For Metzinger, qualia (understood as noncategorizable, but attentionally

 He suggests tackling the issue of reducing them to physicalist terms by
 finding the physical structures upon which sensory content locally supervenes,

However, he does not banish qualia from the ontological landscape entirely:
 “On the contrary, this type of simple, ineffable content does exist and
 there exist higher-order, functionally more rich forms of simple phenomenal

 In its subtleness, its enormous wealth in highly specific, high-dimensional

 in this thesis is the wrong way around.
 It is not phenomenality that enables the perception of qualia, but rather,

 of phenomenality.

Consolidation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Qualia were a somewhat diffuse topic when they were first introduced, and
 the issue is still quite complex.
 Evidence and thought experiments contradict the idea that qualia are atomic
 metaphysical entities that experience is made of.
 Dennett felt this was sufficient to totally abandon the term, while Metzinger
 on the other hand redefined `qualia' and gave them a less metaphysical
 meaning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us look closer at how exactly their views differ.
 Both philosopher's concepts share some similarities:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Both concepts of qualia are in principle reducible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Both concepts of qualia include differentiated ways in which a particular
 experience can be classified into categories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are important differences between their theories.
 The most striking ones are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dennett abandons the term “qualia” altogether, while Metzinger gives the
 term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

qualia
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 an ontological legimitation, namely, that of a specific categorizable and
 transtemporally comparable volume in quality space.
 Still, Metzinger attempts to analyze them and says that that there is nothing
 atomical about them; rather, they are merely paradigmatic definitions of
 arbitrary abstraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dennett's concept of what traditional qualia are is (in addition to their
 reducibility in principle) also practically reducible to purely syntactical
 terms, in that that phenomenological descriptions can always be intersubjective
ly specified and conceptualized.
 Metzinger, on the other hand, in addition to Dennett's intersubjectivizable
 entities, postulates that there is transparent presentational content,
 subsymbolic and non-categorizable, which can not be intersubjectively specified
 or conceptualized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metzinger allows an intersubjective view at qualia, and even presentational
 content: These entities can be intersubjectively individuated by means
 of the neural correlates they supervene on,

 any other conscious system, even if this other system has completely different

 Dennett believes that it would be perfectly possible for us to know what
 it is like to be a bat.
 This implies two things: That the description can completely capture the
 experience, and also that fully reliving the experience (appreciating it)
 based on such a complete description is possible.

 For instance, one person might like hamburgers while another one doesn't,
 for one person the first intuition with hamburgers is Krusty Burgers while
 another one thinks of Burger Queen first, one attributes “tastes good”

 That child is a foreign creature with which our present self is no more
 identified in feeling than it is with some stranger's living child today.
 [...] It is the same with certain of our dimly recollected experiences.
 We hardly know whether to appropriate them or to disown them as fancies,
 or things read or heard and not lived through.

However, Dennett also presents his model of multiple drafts as an alternative
 to the traditional theories of qualia, not only as a stand-alone theory.
 Let us look at how exactly it is not only a fresh approach to how the brain
 works, but also an alternative that can explain the same things as qualia
 did.
 The question whether the theory of multiple drafts necessarily implies
 that there are no (non-eliminable) qualia seems particularly interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make the transition from qualia to the theory of multiple drafts,
 Dennett first notes that one of the prime motivations behind the concept

 Dennett is not opposed to the idea that us making judgements about a color
 is all there is to color vision, but he is also convinced that color vision
 (or rather, our capabilities of making judgements about a color influenced
 by the external world) co-evolved with colored entities in the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that the color is out there somehow after all.
 It is there, ready to be presented to us, and our detectors, specificially
 tailored to detecting them, produce representations within our brains.
 These detectors are specificially built to detect color, and Dennett introduces
 the concept of such purpose-built detectors with an analogy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
A particularly useful example is provided by the famous case of Julius and
 Ethel Rosenberg, who [...] improvised a clever password system: a cardboard
 Jell-O box was torn in two, and the pieces were taken to two individuals
 who had to be very careful about identifying each other.
 Each ragged piece became a practically foolproof and unique 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

detector
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of its mate: at a later encounter each party could produce his piece, and
 if the pieces lined up perfectly, all would be well.
 [...] tearing the cardboard produces an edge of such informational complexity
 that it would be virtually impossible to reproduce by deliberate construction.
 [...] The particular jagged edge of one piece becomes a practically unique
 pattern-recognition device for its mate; it is an apparatus or transducer
 for detecting the shape property 
\emph on
M
\emph default
, where 
\emph on

 is uniquely instantiated by its mate.

Obviously, if entities (or even entity properties) are out there ready to
 be observed, even though we might not be able to clearly define them by
 their physical description alone, there must be detectors that reliably
 find them.
 And how these detectors are built at their core is precisely what the multiple
 drafts theory is about.
 The theory explains perfectly well how it makes sense that qualitative
 properties are out there in the world, ready for us to perceive, and how
 that perception can work without

To conclude, qualia are at the same time reducible and necessary -- a rather

 They form the categorical borders of our conscious experience, but do not

 they the truly atomic building blocks of experience.
 They are a necessary level of abstraction that holds information not contained

There is more to consciousness than merely having phenomenal experiences

For example, let us assume that you think about something you did as a four
 years old child -- either recalling through your own memories, or through
 reminders from your parents or other relatives.
 In such a situation, we might not be able to emphatically put ourselves
 into the shoes of that four years old child anymore; the world we lived
 in back then seems nearly as alien to us now as the world of Nagel's bats.
 We have different value systems now, different and many more experiences
 we can relate to, different theories regarding both the world around us

This seems to be the just moment to incorporate parts of Minsky's work into
 our deliberations: He observes that often, we have not just one, but multiple
 self models.
 Normative ones (what do I want to be like?), descriptive ones (how do I
 usually act in this situation?), of both ourselves and others.
 Often, the models we have of others are (or may appear) more accurate than
 the models these others have of themselves.
 How can that be? Should I not be the final authority when judging what
 it is that makes me myself? Do not I alone have some kind of privileged
 access that should enable me to form a more accurate, a more proper `self'
 than others, who merely form mental (empathical) models of me?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, there are many deviate forms of subjectivity.
 One of these is a recurring theme among Metzinger, Dennett, and many other
 philosophers of mind: The multiple personality disorder.
 Certainly, the best opportunity to examine the `self' is when it is already
 dissected, when its inner workings are more prone to lay bare because the
 protective layer around it has been removed and broken.
 This is metaphorically spoken, but frequently true in a stricter sense,
 as it seems that traumatic childhood experiences are often what causes
 such multiple personality disorders in the first place.

 As I noted in

, I had some difficulties understanding what constitutes a self.
 I still consider it to be one of the most fascinating aspects of the philosophy
 of mind.
 However, the theories of Dennett, Minsky and particularly Metzinger seem
 to be concise argumentations for a modern and scientific model of what
 this `self' could be.

These entities are distinct from each other because Descartes can perceive
 them clearly as being distinct, and God can form such distinct entities
 that are nonetheless linked.
 Furthermore, ideas of external entities are only formed within the 
\emph on
res cogitans
\emph default
, and they are truthful representations of actual external entities, because
 God is not a deceiver.
 Both these (in this thesis, very bluntly put) argumentations rely on the
 truthfulness and benevolence of God, of which further proof is attempted
 earlier in Descartes' work.

 The views expressed in this paper could be seen as a form of such conceptual

 Thus, it is the separation of body and mind, and it did not really start

Finding the subject in dualism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The somewhat pragmatic (and probably for that very reason intuitively plausible)
 approach of Descartes, when he proposes differentiating between a thinking
 matter that is not extended and an extended matter that does not think,
 makes it very easy to point at what creates subjectivity, which at this
 point becomes an only very loosely defined term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is because the very distinguishing criterion for the 
\emph on
res cogitans
\emph default
 is that it is able to produce this subjectivity.
 As such, subjectivity is built into the 
\emph on
res cogitans
\emph default
; this is a logical necessity because a subject is a prerequisite for mental
 contents of any form that are experienced from a first-person point of
 view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Descartes, being deeply religious,
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
He was, of course, a man of science and had a very investigative spirit,
 something that is arguably rarely seen in today's rather traditionalist
 clergy of most religions; insofar he was religious in a sense that today
 would not be typical.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 roots this separation of entities between the 
\emph on
res cogitans
\emph default
 and the 
\emph on
res extensa
\emph default
 in the soul and, in the end, in the divine spirit.
 Strictly looking at what constitutes subjectivity itself however does not
 reveal anything but dogmas -- it is not further analyzable, atomic to scrutiny,
 as the only form of scrutiny available in a purely non-physical context
 is introspection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus, since we are neither able to analytically (physically) analyze a purely
 non-physical entity, nor able to introspectively (mentally) dig deep enough
 to expose the metaphysical processes that would expose subjectivity itself,
 the following is quite all there is to say on this matter:

 This doesn't mean that everything is always in transition, always gradual;
 transitions that look gradual from close up usually look like abrupt punctuatio

 Dennett has this to say concerning the part of the hard problem we are
 currently looking at:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
A self, according to my theory, is [...] an abstraction defined by the myriads
 of attributions and interpretations (including self-attributions and self-inter
pretations) that have composed the biography of the living body whose Center
 of Narrative Gravity it is.
 As such, it plays a singularly important role in the ongoing cognitive
 economy of that living body, because, of all the tings in the environment
 an active body must make mental models of, none is more crucial than the
 model the agent has of itself.

However, that is all he says on the subject of what a self actually is.
 He explores further why it makes sense to have a self, and how magnificient
 a fiction a self is from a functional point of view (and maybe from a teleologi
cal point of view as well, although he does not use that word).
 He also explores the moral implications of a self that is taken to be a
 fiction only, concerning responsibility and agency.
 Since this moral tangent is not main subject of this thesis, I will not
 further pursue that issue.

 Awareness of the existence and continuity of a self as opposed to the world
 is what enables self-directed action in a stricter sense, in two ways:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is necessary to have a self-model in order to be able to plan and carry
 out directed action at what constitutes which space the self is perceived
 as being in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is necessary to have a self-model in order to be able to realize that
 any action is directed at things that are part of the own body.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A self-model also makes various internal parameters (e.g.
 hunger, thirst, hormone and transmitter levels, intestinal states, skin
 temparature) available for cognitive processing and thus reflected action.
 This reflected action, then, is not strictly stimulus-related, but probably
 better understood as being stimulus-inspired, in that stimuli may result
 in activating offline phenomenal states that simulate the self-model in
 certain counterfactual situations.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, I regard it important, at this point,
 to make clear that it is wrong to say that it is wrong to say that the
 self is 
\emph on
an illusion
\emph default
.
 This is because if the self were an illusion, there would need to be somebody
 or something (a self?) having and owning the illusion.
 This would necessarily render the entire argumentation circular -- which
 is precisely what Metzinger's self-model theory has been criticized for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metzinger is aware of this, and also of the fact that it certainly

 In order to explain how this can possibly happen, he draws on Plato's thought

 where we are pictured as being chained to a wall, unable to turn our heads,
 and merely seeing shadows of the things that actually are,
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Platon has two categories of things that actually are: Ideas, which are
 not epistemically graspable by humans directly, and the entities in the
 real world that are merely implementations of these ideas.
 The shadows on the wall of the cave are, in his original work, merely of
 works of human beings, not even of humans themselves.
\end_layout

 cast by a fire in the middle of the cave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many similarities between Plato's cave and Metzinger's self-model
 theory.
 The allegory works for quite a few of Metzinger's postulated entities:
 According to Metzinger, the cave is the complete phenomenal self-model
 that is formed by the entire organism.
 The shadows are low-dimensional phenomenal projections of high-dimensional
 objects,

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 when we are talking about shadows and objects are pretty straightforward:
 They are actual two-dimensional mappings on a surface, cast by three-dimensiona
l objects.
 How this translates to Metzinger's theory: The dimensions of entities that
 are perceived as actual objects in the world are limited by the number
 and nature of the senses we perceive them with.
 We can only perceive the properties that our senses are made for, and even
 then we can only categorize those perceptions in rather rough classifications,
 with limits in all directions.
 What other, maybe just as important, properties an entity might have we
 can not directly perceive.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and the fire is neural dynamics -- information processing that is constantly
 perturbed and modulated by sensory and cognitive input.
 Finally, the cave's wall is merely another aspect of the very same neural
 process.

 The parallels between the two thought experiments are indeed considerable,
 the various entities are directly mappable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there is a fundamental difference between Plato's and Metzinger's
 view.
 Plato believes that it is possible to get up, go out into the sun, and
 then come back and teach people what true forms

\begin_layout Plain Layout
True forms are essentially pure implementations of the aforementioned ideas,
 or even the ideas themselves.
 These are only rationally analyzable, they are abstract concepts, unlike
 the shadows in the cave that are physically perceptible.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 are.
 He believes that there can be enlightenment, true knowledge -- epistemology
 demystified, experienced ontology possible.
 Unfortunately, Metzinger does not follow Plato here -- there is no getting
 up in Metzinger's cave, we have to remain chained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metzinger doubts that we can get up for one reason: There is nobody in the
 cave -- it is empty, the phenomenal self-model is the entire cave and all
 that is contained within it.
 The self-model experiences itself as being in the center, however.
 Shadows, phenomenal representations, real as they may seem, are merely
 interpretations of shaded surfaces.
 The entire cave is nothing but a “continuous online dream about, and internal
 emulation of, itself,”

 The main difference between this kind of dream and the ones we have at
 night is that the latter ones (which we traditionally call

 The PSM is the logical conclusion from what we have explored so far, and

 and the fact that the system is mistaking the generated transparent self-repres

 as a self that actually is not merely a part of an ongoing process but
 has ontological legitimation that goes beyond abstract entities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is Metzinger's main argument for the PSM:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
If all other necessary and sufficient constraints for the emergence of phenomena
l experience are satisfied by a given representational system, the addition
 of a transparent self-model will by necessity lead to the emergence of
 a phenomenal self.
 Phenomenal selfhood results from autoepistemic closure in a self-representing
 system; it is a lack of information.
 The prereflexive, preattentive experience of being someone results directly
 from the contents of the currently active self-model being transparent.
 [...] Under a general principle of ontological parsimony it is not necessary
 (or rational) to assume the existence of selves, because as theoretical
 entities they fulfill no indispensable explanatory function.
 What exists are information-processing systems engaged in the transparent
 process of phenomenal self-modelling.
 All that can be explained by the phenomenological notion of a “self” can
 also be explained using the representationalist notion of a transparent
 self-

 All other parts of the self-model, the phenomenal self that is experienced

Genesis of a conscious phenomenal self-model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A phenomenal self-model does not necessarily have to form, even given many
 of Metzinger's multilevel constraints.
 He specifies the probable (and intuitively plausible) position of a critic
 of his model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
There simply is no conceptually necessary connection [...] from the functional
 and representational constraints so far developed to the phenomenal target
 property of selfhood.
 The representational process of mental self-modeling within a coherent
 world-model and a virtual window of presence, holism and dynamics conceded
 as well, does not 
\emph on
necessarily
\emph default
 lead to the existence of a full-blown phenomenal self.
 [...] A system-model simply is not a 
\emph on
self
\emph default
-model.
 [...] What is needed -- by conceptual necessity -- to take the step from the
 functional property of centeredness and the representational property of
 self-modeling to the consciously experienced phenomenal property of selfhood?

Metzinger's argument to counter this then is very similar to the one we
 already discussed in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, where we established ineffability as being the defining characteristic
 of consciousness.
 It is exactly the phenomenal transparency (constituted by satisfying the
 transparency, globality and presentationality constraints) of the contents
 of our mental self-model which is, as one of two central prerequisites,
 necessary for the conscious self-model.
 The other is that the system has to be able to transparently recognize
 (and identify with) the contents of that self-model as itself.
 Metzinger puts this as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
We do not experience the contents of our self-consciousness as the contents
 of a representational process, and we do not experience them as some sort
 of causally active internal placeholder

Completely transparent self-representation is characterized by the fact

Sustaining a self is a hard piece of work for our brains.
 It thus makes perfect sense that the self is switched off from time to
 time, when it is not needed -- which leads to times of partial or entire
 lack of conscious experience:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The brain, the dynamical, self-organizing system as a whole, 
\emph on
activates
\emph default
 the [self] if and only if it needs the [self] as a representational instrument
 in order to integrate, monitor, predict, and remember its own activities.
 As long as the [self] is needed to navigate the world, the puppet shadow
 dances on the wall of the neurophenomenological caveman's phenomenal state
 space.
 As soon as the system does not need a globally available self-model, it
 simply turns it off.
 Together with the model the conscious experience of selfhood disappears.
 Sleep is the little brother of death.

Minsky: Multiple models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minsky approaches the problem of selves (or rather, the perception of one
 self to a person) from a different point of view.
 He doesn't care that much about the genesis of the phenomenality of a self-mode
l (in fact, he borrows much of the philosophical footwork from Dennett),
 but rather looks at the actual causes and implications of self-models,
 and notices that a person usually has a wide array of multi-tier self-models
 at their disposal.
 Those include normative just like positive / descriptive aspects, and have
 a complex internal structure.

\begin_layout Standard
According to Minsky, there are six levels of mental activities, the total
 of which together then constitute consciousness -- and produce the self-models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minsky, by postulating many levels which seem to be very similar at first
 sight, consciously disregards Occam's Razor in that he does not attempt
 to minimize the number of levels.
 Obviously, that minimization is what science (and in particular, Cartesian
 philosophy) has done for quite some time, without much success in resolving
 how consciousness works, or what constitutes a self.

I think [this policy of minimizing complexity] has badly retarded the field
 of psychology.
 For when you

know

 that your theory is incomplete, then you ought to leave some room for other
 ideas that you later might need.
 Otherwise, you will take the risk of adopting a model so clean and neat
 that new ideas won't fit into it.
\end_layout

I think that this applies especially to making theories about complex structures

 All of these can come either in normative or positive variants.
 Switching between multiple of these subpersonalities (which usually are
 still relatively close to each other) changes what ways to think are available,
 because different brain centers are active and contributing to the functional
 processes generating the current self-model, and thus how we act and think.

 It is interesting to see that newer research in entirely different psychologica

When Caudle's looked for brain areas that were more active when volunteers
 thought about themselves and their avatars compared with real and virtual
 others, two regions stood out: the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior
 cingulate cortex.
 That makes sense as prior research has linked the medial prefrontal cortex
 to self-reflection and judgement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Interestingly, however, there was "next to no difference" in the activity
 in these regions when people thought of themselves and of their avatar,

Personal identity

\begin_layout Standard
The idea of a self, of being an individual, is certainly a stimulating and
 treasured one.
 This has evolutionary origins, or at least is perfectly compatible with
 our biological constraints: We are constrained to one single, localized
 body.
 We have a private mind that nobody else can easily see into.
 We claim moral responsibility for deeds we do and force others to assume
 responsibility for theirs, and construct causal attributions from the position
 of attributing one self to each body.

\begin_layout Standard
All the theories mentioned in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 have in common that they postulate that there is more to the world than
 the physical, and more importantly, they postulate that this additional
 matter is not traceable or detectable by scientific or naturalistic means.
 Essentially, they postulate that there is a kind of causation that is not
 causally analyzable.

, the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
How, precisely, does the information get transmitted from pineal gland to
 mind? [...] let's ignore those upbound signals for the time being, and concentrate
 on the return signals, the directives from mind to brain.
 These,

 No physical energy or mass is associated with them.
 How, then, do they get to make a difference to what happens in the brain
 cells they must affect, if the mind is to have any influence over the body?
 A fundamental principle of physics is that any change in the trajectory
 of any physical entity is an acceleration requiring the expenditure of
 energy, and where is this energy to come from?

 Causes for any kind of effect, whether we can touch and see the effect

Criticising Dennett
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though Dennett's theory on what constitutes a self is fairly thin,
 it is compatible with Metzinger's, which is much more extensive.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Metzinger's theory is more extensive for two reasons.
 First, the PSM (see chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "PSM"

\end_inset

) is one of the two central building blocks of Metzinger's theory and plays
 a core role in his explorations overall, compared to Dennett who merely
 created a chapter on the self being the center of narrative gravity (see
 chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Center-of-Narrative-Gravity"

\end_inset

) that seems more like an afterthought.
 Second, Metzinger also explores tangents and implications, while Dennett's
 deliberations on the subject do not go any further than that, because he
 does not attempt to explain how a self comes to be or whether it has ontologica
l legitimation in an abstract space, but why consciousness as a whole (and
 thus also selves) can be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

explained away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as Dennett himself explains and justifies in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dennett1991"

\end_inset

, page 455:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Only a theory that explained conscious events in terms of unconscious events
 could explain consciousness at all.
 If your model of how pain is a product of brain activity still has a box
 in it labeled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 you haven't yet begun to explain what pain is, and if your model of consciousne

then a miracle occurs
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Dennett's theory of the self as center of narrative gravity also implies
 that the self is merely a model, he calls it a fiction, that the system
 produces in order to make more sense of the following fact: There is a
 physically localized and temporally invariant structure that the phenomenal
 experience is attributed to as belonging to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This compatibility between Metzinger and Dennett is a good thing, because
 both theories seem to lack major fundamental flaws.
 However, Dennett makes a comparison that only holds up to logical scrutiny
 with some limitations:

\begin_layout Quote
If what you are is that organization of information that has structured
 your body's control system (or, to put it in its more usual provocative

 a program can survive the destruction of the computer on which it was created
 and first run.

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding this analogy however, it must be considered that a program cannot
 run on just any computer, at least not without an emulator running first:
 A program that was created for a certain operating system, running on certain
 hardware, will not be able to run on another basis, unless they are explicitly
 made to be compatible through additional programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Applied to the analogy of consciousness, this means: A self relies on an
 enormous number of representative and presentative processes supplying
 it with data about both the environment and the inner state of the body
 that the self belongs to.
 The self also is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

programmed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a many different parallel processes with corresponding aligning (neural)
 pathways -- pathways that themselves shape the processes originating from
 the sensory organs through which data flows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Splitting the self from the body is thus not easily possible, as the body
 constitutes the self's current contents through the topology and states
 of its neurons, and certainly formed the self in the past.
 A computer is radically different from a brain, so in order to emulate
 a human brain on one of today's computers, we would require an emulation
 so complex that it would presuppose more work than the actual `brain software'
 transfer itself.
 The self supervenes on neuronal topology and states, a computer program
 on the other hand supervenes on zeroes and ones -- and translating one
 to the other is not trivial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, if the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

software
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 were to change during execution time, the hardware has to change as well,
 because the hardware (neurons and their connections to other neurons) defines
 the software's contents -- there are apparently around 400 specialized
 and quite static (on a large scale, but changing on a small scale) neural
 areas,

 all of which contribute to what ultimately constitutes the self.

 to human selves, even though Dennett is fairly convinced otherwise.

This stays true unless somebody takes the time and effort to identify and
 translate every possible low-level function call into one that works on

 the more different those hardware bases get, the more work has to be done
 in order to produce an emulation of the original hardware.

Most parts of Dennett's view appear to hold up to logical scrutiny.
 The same thing applies to almost all parts of Metzinger's view, and almost
 all parts of Minsky's view.
 Considering that they contradict each other only in minor points, this
 can only mean one thing: I propose that we blend them together and form
 a theory that incorporates them all.
 The following discussion can be taken as my attempt at doing precisely
 that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since Dennett's ideas on subjectivity are not as detailed as, and can mostly
 be expressed by a subset of, Metzinger's ideas, I think we can for now

 This leaves us with Metzinger's generation of phenomenal self-models, with
 the reservation that not one such self-model is generated during the lifetime
 of a system.

 Thus different parts of the brain provide functional processing abilities,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The various phenomenal self-models are not pure.
 The business self will mix with the parent self when a businesswoman is
 talking with her kids on the phone during her lunch break.
 In such a situation, it is not so much the case that two phenomenal self-models
 are active concurrently, but that the resources required by multiple phenomenal
 self-models are simultaneously active in our brains and thus form a new,
 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 Essentially, an entire suitcase of concepts fits onto one word, which we

 have to belong to the same categories.
 He talks about them in various places in

 Every mental phenomenon includes something as an object within itself,

 In presentation something is presented, in judgement something is affirmed

Jedes psychische Phänomen ist durch das charakterisiert, was die Scholastiker

 Gegenstandes genannt haben, und was wir, obwohl mit nicht ganz unzweideutigen

 Gegenständlichkeit nennen würden.
 Jedes enthält etwas als Objekt in sich, obwohl nicht jedes in gleicher

 Oskar Kraus refers to the same immanent objectivity in a footnote on page

Dennett: Only derived intentionality

Dennett does not believe in intrinsic or original intentionality.
 The essence of the thought experiment that he starts his analysis with
 reads as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Suppose some human being, Jones, looks out the window and thereupon goes
 into the state of thinking he sees a horse.
 [...] Suppose the planet Twin Earth were just like Earth, save for having
 schmorses where we have horses.
 (Schmorses [...] are well-nigh indistinguishable from horses by all but trained
 biologists with special apparatus, but they aren't horses [...].) If we whisk
 Jones off to Twin Earth, land of the schmorses, and confront him in the
 relevant way with a schmorse, then either he really is, still, provoked
 into the state of believing he sees a horse (a mistaken, nonveridical belief)
 or he is provoked by that schmorse into believing, for the first time (and
 veridically), that he is seeing a schmorse.
 [...] However hard it may be to determine exactly which state he is in, he
 is really in one or the other [...].
 Anyone who finds this intuition irresistible believes in original intentionalit
y [...].
 Anyone who finds this intuition dubious if not downright dismissible can
 join me [...] in the other corner [...].

 There, he also lists many philosophers who either agree that there is intrinsic

 Pardon all the ellipsis, I gave my best not to leave out anything important
 for Dennett's extensive introduction of the thought experiment.
\end_layout

This thought experiment is interesting because it challenges our intuitions.
 Schmorses clearly are distinct from horses, from an intrinsic point of
 view, while their external appearance certainly seems to be the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there is such a thing as an intentional arrow (with ontological legitimation
 beyond that of a helpful metaphor), it thus clearly has to point at either
 a schmorse or a horse, because it has to point at 
\emph on
something
\emph default
 or (since it is defined through a start point and an end point) it can
 not exist at all.
 If an intentional arrow is only a helpful metaphor however, it does not
 matter what it really points at, because it does not really point at anything
 at all in a literal sense, and consequently the question whether it actually
 points at a horse or a schmorse makes no sense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dennett goes even further: Not only does he doubt that intentionality can
 be intrinsically about something in particular, he also does not believe
 that there is anything beyond derived intentionality.

The intentional stance

\begin_layout Standard
It is striking how often humans ascribe intentional acts and beliefs to
 less developed animals and even machines, both of which obviously do not
 have any feelings or even states that could properly be classified as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mental
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (or rather, phenomenal) states.
 We also ascribe intentional acts and beliefs to each other, with apparently
 more justification and less metaphorically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This ascription of intentionality to other systems is, according to Dennett,
 the intentional stance.
 It is a stance we enter in which we ascribe intentionality to other systems,
 or even ourselves.
 What makes us ascribe those intentional acts and beliefs to each other,
 however? Dennett makes out three principles:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A system's beliefs are those it 
\emph on
ought to have
\emph default

A system's desires are those it 
\emph on

\emph default

A system's behavior will consist of those acts that

Thus, essentially, evolutionary fitness and rationality are the sole criteria
 for reasonable ascription of intentionality, and ascription of intentionality
 is all there is to true intentionality.
 In other words, according to Dennett, there is no intrinsic intentionality.

Strictly speaking, this definition also means that only biological systems

 However, and I believe we would not run counter to Dennett's intentions

There must indeed be a higher level of description at which we can attribute

 activities, but at such a level the interations and relationships between
 semantic elements are not computational but [...] statistical, emergent, holistic.
 [...] In Connectionist models, the (typically simulated) hardware does add
 something: just which content-relative effects actually occur (something
 that is only statistically describable at the high-level) depends on low-level
 features of the history of operations.
 The different flavors of cognition emerge from the activity, without being
 specifically designed to emerge.

 Similar to Searle not finding anything that could give his Chinese Room's

 it intrinsic intentionality.

Dennett designs a thought experiment in which we would want to experience
 the year 2401, and then build a robot that could contain and protect our
 hibernating body until then.
 Since the world is an inherently dynamic place, merely sitting always in
 the same spot probably could not ensure our survival.
 Consequently, that robot would have to be able to classify things

 deciding; it would essentially exhibit a sophisticated form of derived

 have to show.

With this analyzed and the robot thus designed, Dennett points out:

If we cling to this view [that this artifact would only possess derived

 is exactly like that of the robot, for the science-fiction tale I have
 told is not new; it is just a variation on Dawkins' vision of us (and all
 other biological species) as “survival machines” designed to prolong the
 futures of our selfish genes.
 We are artifacts, in effect, designed over the eons as survival machines
 for genes that cannot act swiftly and informedly in their own interests.
 [...] So our intentionality is derived from the intentionality of our “selfish”
 genes!

Similarly to the PSM (see chapter

Phenomenalizing intentionality

\begin_layout Standard
Metzinger wants to naturalize intentionality, and phenomenalizing it is
 the first necessary step for this naturalization.
 He explains:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Phenomenalizing intentionality, I would submit, may be a necessary detour,
 an indispensable first step in the project of 
\emph on
naturalizing
\emph default

\emph on

\emph default
.
 Meaning and the conscious experience of meaningfulness have to be separated.
 Generally speaking, mental representations possess two kinds of content:
 phenomenal content and intentional content.
 Phenomenal content supervenes locally.
 Intentional content, in many cases, is determined by external and nonlocal
 factors.
 [...] It is important to note how intentionality [...] is

 depicted on the level of phenomenal content.

\begin_layout Standard
Parts of his statement are obvious: Meaning and the conscious experience
 of meaningfulness (which corresponds to intentionality) are not identical,
 although they are phenomenally experienced as being intuitively and unquestiona
bly the same.
 Metzinger argues that while we do know that phenomenal content supervenes
 locally,
\begin_inset Foot

 we do not necessarily know that intentional content, which refers to external
 entities, also supervenes locally.
 If we can show that intentional content is just a special form of phenomenal
 content, it goes without saying that intentional content supervenes locally
 and thus potentially can be naturalized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, showing that intentional content is merely a special form of
 phenomenal content is the chief purpose of the PMIR theory.
 Since according to Metzinger, the phenomenal experience of an intentionality
 relation is all there is to intentionality, phenomenal experience could
 exist completely without ontological counterparts to the entities represented
 by said intentionality relation's phenomenal contents.
 Intentionality could be entirely virtual, and if it were, it would not
 be possible for us to notice.
 In fact, it is quite possible that we misrepresent many things out there
 in the world, because this misrepresentation has proved to be more beneficial
 for the continued survival of our species:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
This global effect [of “global immersion”] is achieved by continuously activatin
g dynamic and transparent representations of a subject-object relation,
 which episodically integrates the self-model and those perceptual, cognitive
 or volitional objects, which cause the changes in its content, by telling
 an internal story about how these changes came about.
 This story does not have to be a true story.
 It may well be a greatly simplified confabulation, which has proved to
 be functionally adequate.

 Without volition, even goal-driven movement cannot be experienced as agency

Consolidation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems hard to be talking about intentionality while avoiding the matter
 of consciousness or subjective experience in general.
 The two concepts are very closly related -- or rather, they are interwoven.
 Brentano already pointed this out when he revived the concept of intentional
 inexistence.
 Intentionality is the prime precondition for consciousness, because all
 conscious mental processes are also directed at something (directed at
 an intentional object) and originate from an intentional subject.
 Metzinger puts it as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
We can now see how a full-blown subjective consciousness evolves through
 three major levels: The generation of a world-model, the generation of
 a self-model, and the transient integration of certain aspects of the world-mod
el 
\emph on
with
\emph default
 the self-model.
 What follows is a minimal working concept of subjective experience: Phenomenall
y subjective experience consists in transparently modeling the intentionality
 relation within a global, coherent model of the world embedded in a virtual
 window of presence.

With intentionality sitting at the core of consciousness, so much so that
 it is often used as the defining characteristic of or even synonymously
 to consciousness, it is very important that we have a clear picture of
 what it actually is.
 Metzinger, and to a lesser extent Dennett, offered us a possibility to
 naturalize intentionality without losing the information which an intrinsic
 intentionality could provide, while at the same time allowing us better
 insight into how it is produced and what its effects on the physical brain
 are.
 This certainly seems to be a worthy approach to take.

This does not imply that I believe that our current scientific theories
 (or theoretical frameworks, or fundamental scientific entities) contain
 the answers to all the questions, or even that our current scientific paradigms
 need to be the ones that prevail.
 But arguably, scientific theories could in theory be formed that contain
 all the answers, using rational argumentations as their foundation.
 Some basic principles of science (mostly, conclusive logic, causal analysis
 and semantical coherence) will necessarily lead us to a better understanding
 of the world that we have only just just started to analyze.

Sidestepping these basic principles and dogmatically defining some mysteries

 If something (me, for example) ascribes intentionality to something, it

Intentional acts for us humans have what Nagel might call a what-is-it-like-ness

 They are phenomenal in nature.
 This is implicitly included in the mere notion of intentionality -- intentional

 an intentional act.
 We also know that for example a computer which is merely following a script,
 this following of the script can not possibly be anything like us conducting
 such an intentional act.
 In fact, it seems improbable that for today's computers, following a script
 has any what-is-it-like-ness to it at all.

Well, then, what does rotting chicken smell like to a turkey vulture? [...]
 We can uncover the corresponding family of reactive dispositions in the

 more and more about the no doubt highly idiosyncratic relations a vulture
 can form to a set of olfactory stimuli.
 But we already know a lot that we won't learn.
 We will never find a vulture being provoked by those stimuli to wonder,
 as a human being might, whether the chicken is not just slightly off tonight.
 And we won't find any amusement or elaborate patterns of association or
 Proustian reminiscence.
 Am I out in front of the investigations here? A little bit, but note what
 kind of investigations they are.
 It turns out that we end up where we began: analyzing patterns of behavior
 (external and internal -- but not “private”), and attempting to interpret
 them in the light of evolutionary hypotheses regarding their past or current
 functions.

 Personally, I find it puzzling that Dennett should say that consciousness
 is a gradual phenomenon and then assume that vultures have no dispositional
 stances in their intentional relations that are similar to our amusement
 or wondering.
 Of course, even if they are similar, it is very improbable that they are
 exactly the same despite all the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 at all.

Dennett does not ascribe any special meaning to phenomenality (see chapter
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Heterophenomenology"

\end_inset

).
 Arguably however, for an observer-relative ascription of intentionality
 to be intuitively intentional, it has to be conducted by a system that
 has phenomenal states.
 The state has to be a specimen of 
\emph on
phenomenal
\emph default
 intentionality for the system, and it has to satisfy at least Metzinger's
 perspectivalness and transparency constraints.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two argumentative approaches for disproving Dennett's claim that
 intentionality can exist without phenomenality:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dennett does not account for the special kinds of ineffability (see chapter
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Phenomenality-for-Metzinger"

\end_inset

) that goes with phenomenal experience, and thus does not appear to account
 for actual, real-world intentional experience at all.
 Dennett's entire argumentation builds on the assumption that there are
 no strictly private such experienced patterns.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Dennett does agree that we have priviledged access to internal states.
 This is, however, not enough, as this does not account for ineffability.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 And Metzinger clearly shows that not only are there such private patterns,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Phenomenality-for-Metzinger"

 but also why they are private: Because they are causally active (and thus
 can not just be ignored), but not introspectively accessible -- which is
 precisely Metzinger's definition of them being transparent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The ineffable parts could of course be described as well in principle --
 finding and properly describing them would be incredibly hard, but not
 impossible.
 However, not even heterophenomenology would be sufficient there, as this
 phenomenal presentational content may be available for introspection, but
 is not symbolic -- we would need both a full functional description of
 the human brain and a complete neurological map of it in order to even
 have a chance at uncovering that description.
 However, this is where appreciation stops working -- as soon as we merely
 have a description, we can not relive the experience, and thus it can not
 be fully appreciated anymore (see chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Difference-Appreciation-Description"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dennett's position appears to be too good at what it aims at: Simplifying
 the subject at hand.
 His theory simplifies intentionality so much that essential parts of it
 get lost in the process.
 This is why his theory appears to be counter-intuitive: It does not account
 for the fact that we experience intentionality as a phenomenal entity,
 and parts of it are ineffable and subsymbolic.
 Merely describing the symbolic parts does not account for the entire experience.

Subsequently, this leads to the possibility of modeling the phenomenal

you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 meaning modeling the experience of being confronted with another agent,
 another person.
 This task really is not only one of simulation, but also one of emulation.
 We are able to `read the minds' of other humans, to some extent, by constructin
g complex models of their selves which include goal structures and predicted
 motor behaviour.
 It has been shown that some of the same neural structures that an observed
 human activates, for example, for moving a finger, are also being activated
 in observers' brains when other agents execute these actions.
 Metzinger explains this as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The motor representation embedded in this partition [...] underlies the conscious
 experience of 
\emph on
being a self in the act of imitating
\emph default
.
 The motor representation not embedded in the PSM is neither opaque nor
 transparent.
 It is a functional property, possibly not even directly reflected on the
 level of phenomenal experience.
 It is a part of the unconscious self-model which, however, is currently
 used as a model of a certain part of external reality, of the social environmen
t, namely, as an 
\emph on
other
\emph default
 self-model.

So, having a phenomenal self-model like we do is a very efficient way of
 enabling intersubjectivity by means of enabling empathy.
 Only if we perceive of other persons as agents can we act according to
 that fact, and only if we can model some of their goals and mental states
 (or at least goals and mental states that we would have if we were them)
 can we take these into account and act accordingly.

The goal of this thesis is an analysis of the semantic field that surrounds
 consciousness.
 Phenomenology, qualia, subjectivity, intentionality -- they all have common
 sense meanings (see part 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "The-Four-Questions"

\end_inset

) and were subject of much discussion, but appear to be disconnected and
 overlapping at the same time.
 We started out with rough definitions of the four parts, and then looked
 at each of them, trying to put together the opinions of more traditional
 exponents with those of Dennett and Metzinger, and then attempting to find
 a consensus among the sometimes conflicting theories that we found.

 With all the single components in place, we now know that full phenomenality
 partly relies on subjectivity, while subjectivity itself relies on some
 of the multilevel constraints that make up the rest of phenomenality.
 We have established that intentionality relies on some basic form of self,

 Metzinger's perspectivalness constraint

 (see chapter

 It appears that further research into what exactly constitutes this prereflexiv

 Nevertheless, it follows from Metzinger's argumentation that at least the
 following two factors are important prerequisites for the capability of
 our bodies and brains
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Other systems capable of creating a prereflexive proto self-model would
 require similar prerequisites.
 This implies that for example a distributed neural network can not create
 the same sense of

 to form it:

Functional presentation centers in the brain that are responsible for receiving
 nerve cell input from various body parts, including inner organs.
 These functional presentation centers are grown, as phantom limb experiments

 of view, and also assigning entities and properties to the `first person'
 this point of view originates from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arguably, this prereflexive proto-self is not only a prerequisite for the
 PSM and the PMIR, but also a prerequisite for phenomenal experience itself:
 Without such a first-person point of view, the possibility of localizing
 sensory inputs is not given, and thus any higher concepts that refer to
 locations in any way cannot possibly be formed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consciousness that has no such proto self-model may well have coherent

 (homogeneity of simple content and the non-existence of a grain problem)
 really is a prerequisite for convolved holism.
 This is the case because we get into an infinite regress otherwise when
 attempting to subdivide former wholes infinitely, which is exactly what
 the grain problem is about.
 Consequently, it will have to be included in this step as well, although
 it will only be required for its true strength, concept formation, when
 we introduce qualia.

\begin_layout Standard
As we found in chapter

 Minsky's reservations (see chapter

) still apply, however: Not all the processess have access to all the data,
 but it certainly seems that way because we are wired in ways that make
 all the

\end_layout

 It is ready for input.

Phenomenal presentational content

\begin_layout Standard
As we saw in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Phenomenal-Presentational-Content"

\end_inset

, qualia are not the atomic entities they were made out to be.
 Phenomenal presentational content is the most basic form of experience,
 because there are kinds of nonconceptual experience that are so subtle
 and fine-grained that they cannot be categorized.
 These special sub-qualia entities are not accessible for concept formation
 or transtemporal reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notably, while the step of 
\emph on
presenting
\emph default
 phenomenal content to a system is somewhat trivial from a philosophical
 perspective, it is very complicated from a computational point of view.
 Most of today's attempts at producing weak artificial intelligence are
 struggling with exactly this step.
 It mostly includes pattern matching tasks: Speech recognition, facial recogniti
on, three-dimensional object perception, orientation, memory formation,
 and plenty of other, similarly complicated things.

 as it is not possible to build them from scratch, not even for an efficient

 phenomenality.

Basic subjectivity

\begin_layout Standard
I attempted to merge the theories of Minsky and Metzinger in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Multiple-Phenomenal-Self-Models"

\end_inset

.
 According to this combination of their argumentations, subjectivity is
 really about multiple phenomenal self-models that the phenomenal system
 forms -- out of phenomenal presentational content that is invariant and
 thus perceived as internal (which essentially is the way the proto self-model
 is transparently presented to the system), plus social influences and conventio
ns.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These self-models consist of the six levels of Minsky that somewhat correspond
 to Freud's distinction between Id, Ego and Super-Ego.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Six-levels-of-self"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, for the higher levels among them we require an intentionality
 relation, so only two levels (those correlating to the Freudian Id) are
 part of basic subjectivity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
`Instinctive Reactions' - requiring no self-model yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
`Learned Reactions' - forming a simple self-model that includes the bipartition
 between self and world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These levels are necessarily entirely transparent, because as soon as we
 want to add opacity, we need a way to relate to the opaque parts -- which
 is only possible if we can model intentionality, and intentionality is
 only added in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Summary-Intentionality"

\end_inset

.
 Basic subjectivity, however, is more than the prereflexive proto self-model,
 in that it incorporates sensory input and allows processing it in various
 ways.

Intentionality

\begin_layout Standard
In order to progress any further from basic subjectivity, it is necessary
 to consciously model the relation of the system depicted by such basic
 subjectivity to both the world model and its own self-model.
 Otherwise, we have to remain at a level that is barely conscious at all
 -- a purely reactive system in many ways, and certainly not one to which
 we could make reasonably meaningful ascriptions of intentionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Dennett showed, intrinsic intentionality, as intuitively plausible as
 it may be, does not seem to have any justification that goes beyond mere
 intuition.

 Thus, if we want a rational theory, we have but one choice: The theory
 has to refrain from relying on intrinsic intentionality, and consequently,
 we need a replacement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conveniently, we have a replacement in Metzinger's phenomenal model of the
 intentionality relation:

 The intentionality relation is nothing but a phenomenal model, it only
 has an abstract conceptual legitimation, every intentional relation supervenes
 locally on brain structures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metzinger's model of the intentionality relation is an entity which is continuou
sly being rebuilt in a dynamic process, hardwired in the brain, that allows
 us to 
\emph on
re
\emph default
present entities which formerly were mere presentata.
 It is phenomenal in that we experience it as being meaningful, and it depicts
 the relation from the transparently represented subject component to an
 object component which is one among a huge selection of entities that would
 qualify for filling the “object component” slot
\begin_inset Foot

See chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 in a system's intentional modeling framework.
 Notably, this object component does not need to correlate to any entities
 external to the system, we might be mistaken about all the things we experience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That relation between subject and object component is then presented as
 being a certain 
\emph on
kind
\emph default
 of such relation -- having an attitude specificator (for propositional
 attitude psychology) or intentional content (for Husserlian phenomenality).
 These kinds of relations in turn are presented as equivalence classes that
 the system can represent, and consequently analyze, by making them object
 components of a phenomenal model of an intentionality relation of their
 own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that the PMIR has to be able to accomodate large classes of both
 object components and attitude specificators.
 It has to be able to present all of these object components as the same
 kind of object component -- the kind of “the entity that I currently relate
 to.” And it has to present all of these attitude specificators as “the way
 in which I relate to that entity.”

As we established in chapter

\begin_layout Standard
While qualia are thus the true test for ultrasmoothness because it is now
 
\emph on
required

 for us forming categories of phenomenal presentational content, we did
 introduce the ultrasmoothness constraint for basic phenomenality already

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Qualia-Still-Necessary"

, we concluded that even though traditional qualia as truly atomic entities
 cannot stand when faced with phenomenal presentational content that in
 fact 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 subdivide it (meaning that qualia cannot possibly be atomic and undivisible),
 qualia still have legitimation as the concept of volumes of qualitative
 space, as borders of the concept formative capabilities of a system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a matter of fact, there are other prerequisites for qualia as well.
 We need to be able to form concepts, and for that we require ways to relate
 to phenomenal presentational content.
 Thus, we need both basic subjectivity (or we would not know what it is
 that relates to the presentational content) and intentionality (or we could
 not relate to it at all).

Such self-models are then created for descriptive context-dependant positive
 analysis tasks, but also for normative goal-relative tasks.
 The normative tasks can be ethical, moral, or serving other goals that
 the agent itself can form -- they can be entirely altruistic or entirely
 egoistic in nature.
 Human agents are a superb example for this because they are really creative

 As such, the possibility for us to form a self-model is also one of the
 necessary conditions for meaningful (in the same experiential sense) language
 generation, because only if you can model somebody as a person is it possible

Even better, we even have some slight idea what those causal powers could
 be! They are the constraints Metzinger suggested, with some minor variations,
 and in a slightly more complex layering.
 The special causal powers of the brain that make us conscious subjects
 are the very same that make us able to experience the world phenomenally
 as a subject.

The only one of Metzinger's constraints that we did not add yet in our new
 seven levels from chapter

 is the adaptivity constraint,

 the reason for this will become apparent in chapter

 Not only that, but the added layers clarified and made explicit some interdepen

 contribute to a more sound foundation for the philosophy of consciousness
 overall.

The special nature of the adaptivity constraint

\begin_layout Standard
According to the adaptivity constraint

, everything has to make sense from an evolutionary perspective.
 Metzinger designed it as a constraint that specifies that a system needs
 a proper history, but as shown in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Weaker-Adaptivity"

\end_inset

, this is not necessary for the system to be conscious.
 Still, I proposed a modified fitness criterion for the adaptivity constraint
 as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Phenomenal representata are 
\emph on
good 
\emph default
representata if, and only if they successfully and reliably depict those
 causal properties of the interaction domain of an organism that are important
 for successful survival of the genotype
\emph on
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The modified form of the adaptivity constraint built upon this criterion
 is certainly necessary for a conscious system which is also perceivable
 as such by us: It seems doubtful that we could classify a system as having
 phenomenal subjective experience if it does not exhibit any behaviours
 that we would expect from a system capable of that, which is, behaviours
 that are beneficial for the survival and integrity of the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversely, an instinct-driven system that exhibits all the characteristics
 of one, but also has phenomenal subjective experience that is unrelated
 to the capability to survive, would be classified as merely instinct-driven
 and again, we would not perceive it as being conscious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constraint is, however, not a necessary part of any of the steps in
 chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "The-Bigger-Picture"

\end_inset

.
 Consequently, the modified adaptivity constraint must be the difference
 between a system that merely experiences phenomenally from a first-person
 point of view,
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Such a system would probably vanish within a relatively short time frame.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and one that we would classify as a conscious system.
 The modified adaptivity constraint is what consciousness visible from outside
 the system.

Conceptual dualism?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Dualism"

\end_inset

 introduced substance dualism, and chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "On-dualism"

\end_inset

 explained my reasons for not including it in the summary: If we assume
 that a causal connection between mental entities and physical entities
 exists, which is necessary for our thoughts and wishes having any influence
 over the way our body acts, it follows necessarily that they need potentially
 
\emph on
traceable
\emph default
 causal links.
 This means that if there are domain borders to cross between the two kinds
 of entities, there need to be causally analyzable ways to cross these domain
 borders -- both bottom-up from neural pathways to mental concepts, and
 top-down from phenomenal experience to brain structures and states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, phenomenal entities, according to Metzinger, supervene locally on brain
 properties.
 As we found in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Local-supervenience"

\end_inset

, this means that phenomenal presentational content, which is a kind of
 abstract conceptual content, is realized in electrical currents and layouts
 of neural networks.
 However, while it is possible to map from one of these kinds of content
 to the other, this is not easy, and both levels can be analyzed rather
 individually:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We can discuss and analyze biological neural networks and how the brain
 works, figuring out the interdependences that various brain centers have,
 and the functional responsibilities different areas of the brain assume.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We can (as this thesis does) discuss and analyze phenomenal experience and
 mental states, abstract processes that lead to consciousness, and analyze
 the concept formation and modeling tasks that the system is capable of.

 Metzinger already did some research concerning the physical-neurobiological
 implementation of each of his constraints,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In fact, Metzinger wrote a chapter for each of his multilevel constraints,
 attempting dissect its physical-neurobiological

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Metzinger's-nomenclature"

\end_inset

\end_layout

 but for many of them he could only offer speculations concerning where
 and how exactly they are implemented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interesting thing now is that this does not stop us from analyzing causal
 dependencies between different abstract and conceptual mental entities.
 We can base research about the phenomenal level entirely on observations
 and even, to some extent,

 On the other hand, we can also research neural connections and brain structures
 without even having to think about what supervenes on them.
 In this way, the two levels are, while interconnected, also quite independent
 of each other.

This is, interestingly, similar to how a programmer thinks about his computer
 programs.
 When I program, I do not think about how exactly my higher-level code will
 be translated to bits and bytes, processor instructions and memory contents.
 I do not need to know how the compiler exactly translates them.
 A researcher who does not know the history of computing might take a seemingly
 unbiased approach and say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there is a spirit in this machine that allows it to process words and images,
 for this is more than merely mathematical calculation

This is a more thorough way of stating what chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "Qualia-Still-Necessary"

 but not necessarily easily so.
 Thus qualia simplify talking about the abstract, supervening level, without
 having to worry about the physicalist and complex details.

\begin_layout Quote
What we do suggest is that the human race might easily permit itself to
 drift into a position of such dependence on the machines that it would
 have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines' decisions.
 As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and
 machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make
 more of their decisions for them, simply because machine-made decisions
 will bring better results than man-made ones.
 Eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep
 the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable
 of making them intelligently.
 At that stage the machines will be in effective control.

However, all we can do is try to find out whether these other systems can
 be intelligent, and then talk about what exactly the premises are (if there
 are any) that make it impossible for them to be intelligent, based on informati
on and not doubt.
 We should admit that as long as no proof either way exists, we do not know
 for sure which systems can potentially be conscious.
 This thesis and the theory presented certainly points towards more kinds
 of systems having this potential than previously suggested.

We need to be on the way towards a better understanding of the hard problem

 on the things we do not know, and to narrow down what it is that we do
 not yet understand.
 I think that Dennett, Metzinger and Minsky provide important guidance.
 Some incompatibilities had to be clarified, but I also have called attention
 to many areas where the fusion of their theories proved to be fruitful
 and able to explain more than the parts individually.
