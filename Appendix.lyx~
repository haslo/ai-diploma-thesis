Artificial Intelligence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I set out to write this diploma thesis, I planned sections about artificial
 intelligence -- where we stand, what positions and approaches there are,
 and how we can attempt to incorporate the findings from philosophy of mind
 into research from computer science.
 Unfortunately, I had to cut these parts eventually -- there just wasn't
 enough place to talk about all of that as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, I do believe that artificial intelligence is one of the scientific
 fields of research that can help philosophy of mind, and vice versa.
 Computer science is where a philosopher of mind can experiment and put
 his theories to the test.
 And conversely, philosophy of mind is where a computer scientist can draw
 inspiration for experiments in artificial intelligence from.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Weak and Strong Artificial Intelligence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I may not agree with the point about strong artificial intelligence being
 impossible that John Searle makes in his Chinese Room thought experiment.

 for my discussion of it.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 But in the discussion following the article, he does put forth a very important
 and necessary distinction: The one between weak and strong artificial intellige
nce.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weak artificial intelligence is a mere simulation of intelligent behaviour.
 It might fool us, it might even pass the Turing Test,
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
See 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or it might be different altogether from the way us humans act and think
 and reliably solve problems us humans can't solve.
 Weak artificial intelligence basically is any kind of systematic behaviour
 that seems as if it was intelligent to us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, all (or at least, most) of today's efforts that go towards
 producing artificial intelligence are purely behaviourist.
 We try to replicate human-like behaviour, and think that the machines that
 we produce will then automatically become intelligent and (more importantly)
 conscious.
 I think that this thesis shows up at least some hints as to why this approach
 will not necessarily lead to truly conscious systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strong artificial intelligence on the other hand is true intelligence that
 includes subjectivity, phenomenality and intentionality, one that can feel
 qualia.
 Essentially, it is artificial intelligence after we've solved the hard
 problem of consciousness, and successfully applied the solution to an artificia
l system.
 As Metzinger rightly points out

, that doesn't necessarily have to be a purely technological system -- it
 can well be a postbiotic one, with artificially grown neurons, or maybe
 with quantum computers, or a technology we haven't discovered yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Need for a New Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minsky is a proponent of an older tradition of artificial intelligence,
 a more formal one that puts less focus on self-learning systems.
 Let's hear what he has to say about genetic algorithms and neural networks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
I'd like to argue that if you're interested in artificial intelligence these
 days you're exposed to a lot of arguments that ...
 well, in the early days, people tried to do things with symbolic AI, sometimes
 contemptuously called old-fashioned AI, and that was too rigid and rule-based
 and mechanical, and it had to be programmed.
 What happened starting around 1980 was that most AI researchers tried to
 move in the direction of making machines smart without programming them,
 by using neural networks or genetic algorithms or statistical models.
 The value of that is that you're hoping that your machine can learn to
 be smart without your knowing how it does it.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While neither him nor me want to diminish the value of the many achievements
 of artificial intelligence research in recent years, he does have a point:
 We cannot expect from our machines to learn to be smart without us knowing
 how not only it'll do that, but also how it could even learn that.

 We have to set some guidelines, and for that we have to find out what those
 guidelines will have to be first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
How This Thesis Fits In
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I do believe that this thesis here does help in going towards a new approach.
 Arguably, we need a framework, a base that allows all the other important
 parts of current research in artificial intelligence to work together,
 to form a bigger whole.
 They are the Ways to Think of a porential future postbiotic or artificial
 consciousness.
 They are what enables it.
 But in addition to these Ways to Think, we need something they are embedded
 in.
 A thing producing phenomenality, a transparent representation system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To say it with Minsky, when he talks about how all of the currently employed
 strategies and methods of producing (weak) artificial intelligence have
 this weakness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
In fact, all of these methods are very useful for certain problems.
 What we don't know in general is: For what kind of problem is it good to
 use a statistical inference system? What kinds of problems are ones that
 can be learned and handled by neural networks or by genetic algorithms?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
What I'm proposing along with Gerry Sussman and Hal Abelson is to develop
 a new kind of AI system that has places in which we can insert all of the
 useful results that tens of thousands of AI researchers have made.

What conclusions we reached from the theories of Dennett, Metzinger and
 Minsky could well be part of that foundation.
 If not, at least I hope they are part of our way there, even if I am completely
 mistaken with my conclusions.
 Because as Dennett says:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Making mistakes is the key to making progress.
 [...] Instead of turning away in denial when you make a mistake, you should
 become a connoisseur of your own mistakes, turning them over in your mind
 as if they were works of art, which in a way they are.
 You should seek out opportunities to make grand mistakes, just so you can
 then recover from them.

The Less Hard, But Still Hard Problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I attempted to look at what it is that enables phenomenality and subjectiv
ity in conscious systems, there are plenty of other things that are required
 for a truly conscious system like us humans are.
 Most of these subjects are already topic of extensive research.
 Many of them are in the prime focus of today's attempts to produce artificial
 intelligence, while others are subject of psychological, neurophysiological,
 or even didactical fields of science.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will only briefly touch all these subjects, while giving some pointers
 as to what research I found that helps enlighten our understanding of them,
 but keep in mind that there is much more that could be said about any of
 them.
 I would even go so far as to say that we do not fully understand any of
 them -- we're not able to, exactly because they all are so interwoven with
 the hard problem of consciousness itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Presentational Content Generation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is, as a matter of fact, one of the prime topics of today's research
 into (deliberately weak) artificial intelligence.
 Pattern recognition tasks are necessary for conceptualization of sensory
 input (in the case of artificial intelligence, often through cameras, scanners
 or in the form of text or other prepared data) -- and exactly these pattern
 recognition tasks are what the modeled (trivial versions of) neurons in
 neural networks are particularly good at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, today's artificial algorithms are nowhere near as good as
 the ones evolution gave us humans.
 As it turns out, and as was not expected at first, it really is the case
 that those things that appear to be easiest to us humans seem to be really
 hard for a computer, while obviously complex things like playing chess
 are comparably trivial.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At least until we attempt to model the half-intuitive way us humans play
 chess -- a traditional computer program does it through raw computational
 power and predefined libraries.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These pattern matching tasks are so close to what we will need for forming
 presentational content for one reason: Our brain only works with concepts,
 not with sensory data itself.
 And in order to be able to work with these concepts, they have to be formed
 -- they have to be grouped and categorized.
 This grouping and categorization 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 a kind of pattern matching, and it is exactly what optical character recognitio
n (OCR) or similar tasks where pattern matching is employed are about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Integration of Memory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The kind of memory that a mind like ours requires is pretty complex.
 It consists of way more than just the raw, abstract and atomic pieces of
 data we currently use for storing data in computers.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
That isn't to say that it would be impossible in principle to store such
 semantic data on current-day computer hard drives, but there would need
 to be an abstraction layer between this semantic and a trivial raw representati
on of said data.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The resourcefulness capabilities of a human brain are vast and diverse
 -- we do not directly access our knowledge, but often reason by analogies,
 and certainly associate by such analogies.
 Minsky calls the structures we use for this kind of reasoning “panalogies,”
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

 for “parallel analogies.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Analogies because every entity in our memory, every bit of knowledge is
 linked to multiple other bits -- to similar objects, to properties, to
 a time and place if it is an episodic memory, to solutions if the entity
 is a known problem, and generally to other related entities and concepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Parallel because every bit of knowledge is embedded in different realms
 (physical, dominion, mental, and more) with such analogies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This kind of knowledge representation also requires quite a broad basis
 of “common sense” knowledge,

 as for being able to form analogies like that we need something the new
 piece of knowledge could be analog to.

 memory

 Learning essentially simplifies decision-making by storing context-relative
 data (patterns, knowledge, motor behaviour) in ways that are then retrievable
 later in the relevant (or relevantly similar) contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are quite some steps in memory formation -- the process flow consists
 of at least encoding, storage, consolidation, recall and oblivion.
 “Learning” is a suitcase word

 that encompasses all of the processes up to recall -- encoding and storage
 are obvious, but consolidation is definitely an important part of it as
 well; it is embedding atomic facts in the panalogies that make them available
 for context-relative retrieval later on.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This means that I do not believe that there is such a thing as properly
 non-associative learning.
 Semantic memory may not be stored associated to the context it was learned
 in, but it certainly is associated with the contexts it is potentially
 useful in.
 Otherwise, I do not see how it could possibly be retreived later on.
 As such, there is probably a gradual and not a binary difference between
 episodic and semantic memory -- a memory is episodic to the extent that
 it is associated (semantically, or at least experienced as such) with the
 circumstances it was obtained in.

 We need less time to reorient (in the sense of having to form new counterfactua
l self-models, often with motor simulations, that we then need to compare
 with the goal state) and thus can spend more time on executing behaviour
 that is efficient in regards to reaching a goal state.
 This can go so far that we are able to execute that behaviour while being
 consciously engaged with an entirely different subject.
 The behaviour itself is also more efficient, because learning allows us
 to anticipate common problems and avoid errors we made in earlier attempts
 of executing the action we improved through the learning process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This makes it clear why teaching an action is often difficult for people
 who learned to do that action really well: They no longer need to think
 about the (motor or lower-level mental) behaviours they are performing,
 they internalized them to a large extent and thus are no longer necessarily
 able to make these deliberations and motor behaviours explicit.

Goal Representations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One kind of panalogy, and one that fundamentally influences at least our
 normative self-models, is what we call “goal.” But, what are goals, with
 what are they linked, and how do we go about pursuing them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, goals are in a hierarchical structure -- leaving intuition aside,
 this directly follows from the convolved holism constraint (4).
 The nature of goals then is more of a subject for psychological and didactical
 research than for philosophy or neurophysiology.
 Arguably, goals are not much more than bits of memory (grouped in panalogies)
 that have normative force.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bits of memory that can serve as goals are, so it seems, always (partial)
 self-models or (partial) world models -- a lot of money, a happy state
 of mind, love, peace on earth with fluffy bunnies everywhere.
 While executing actions, we can then as per the offline activation constraint
 (8) access those goal models, run mental simulations and compare the results
 of the actions in world zero to the goal states.
 Minsky describes this as a constent process where we describe the current
 state, compare it with a description of the desired state, select a difference
 through built-in difference detectors

Creativity is a subject that often comes up when the hard problem is being
 discussed, and indeed it is an important part of intelligence.
 As a matter of fact, Minsky goes even further and claims that resourcefulness
 (which he describes as having many ways to think available and thus being
 able to approach problems from many different angles -- which is arguably
 the same thing as creativity) is one of the three defining characteristics
 of intelligence, together with persistence and aim.

\begin_layout Standard
Since all these things rely on representations of memories and goals, on
 how many ways to think were obtained how and what goals and subgoals are
 active at the moment, this leads to a very unpredictable behaviour, particularl
y from a third-person point of view.
 And unpredictability is exactly the thing that makes creativity special,
 and that makes it intuitively impossible for machines to have it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arguably however, given sufficiently chaotic inputs (and maybe some deeper
 forms of randomness than our current approaches handle, since quantum effects
 will most probably influence what's happening in the brain), it is not
 impossible for another resourceful system to exhibit creative behaviour.

Knowledge

\begin_layout Standard
There are several theories that attempt to explain what we mean when we
 speak of knowledge.
 Considering it is always conscious minds that are interesting systems when
 we look at what knowledge is, and how nearly all epistemological research
 so far has been done from a human first-person perspective, we can quite
 safely say that epistemology

Epistemology is the philosophy of knowledge, but also of the possibilities,
 boundaries, preconditions and forms of knowledge (in a broad, philosophical
 sense) -- reducing it to just 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the theory of knowledge
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 does narrow it down too much.
 That is why this section is called

 knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theories as to what exactly knowledge is are varied and disputed.
 A commonly accepted view, dating back to Plato's Theaetetus

, is that knowledge is a justified true belief.
 In formal terms: A subject S knows that a proposition P is true if, and
 only if:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
P is true

Truth be told, that still does not answer what knowledge really is, because
 it depends on the definition of a true belief.

Problems of correspondence theories of knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Correspondence theory is, at least at a first sight, very intuitive.
 Something cannot be called a truth unless it actually really is true.
 In order to be actually really true, it has to correspond to some ideal
 of truth (similar to Platon's ideas).
 There are several problems with that approach however, as it seems to be
 impossible to find out what those ideals are.
 If in this chapter I speak of

\begin_layout Standard
Similar arguments apply for empirical introspection.
 If we are to believe that we can introspectively gain proper knowledge
 about all aspects of our mental world we direct introspective attention
 at, we have to believe, like Descartes, that we cannot be wrong about our
 own mental states.

 states through introspection.

There are various counter-examples to that view however.
 Trivially, there are pathological cases where patients believe they are

 The question whether those patients are still rational agents can reasonably
 be asked -- arguably, they are, since their rational argumentations are
 sound if one accepts the premise that they don't exist.
 As we will see, this is transparently given as unquestionably immediate
 for them, just like existence is given for us.

 But there are other, non-pathological cases that make the fallibility of
 introspective access evident as well:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
In one study, subjects were presented with four pairs of stockings and asked
 to indicate which pair had the highest quality.
 The leftmost pair was preferred by a factor of almost four to one.
 However, unbeknownst to the subjects, all four pairs of stockings were
 identical.
 Though position effects were clearly playing a role in the subjects’ choice,
 none of them identified position when asked to explain their reasoning,
 and those who were asked explicitly whether position played any role in
 their reasoning process all denied it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
However interesting this result, Nisbett and Wilson’s work might not seem
 especially threatening to most proponents of infallibility, since it concerns
 introspective access only to higher order reasoning processes [...].
 In contrast, empirical work on “changeblindness,” which calls into question
 our introspective access to our current perceptual states, seems to pose
 a deeper threat.
 According to work done by Kevin O’Regan (who works, ironically, at the
 Universite Rene Descartes in France), subjects typically fail to notice
 even large changes to objects in their visual field, as long as the change
 occurs simultaneously with some other “disruption,” such as a blink or
 a mudsplash on a windshield.

I think that epistemology is, in fact, not such a complicated subject as
 we assume it to be -- and obviously, not as complicated as it seems from
 my discussion so far.
 The only way in which we can know whether a belief is not only justified,
 but also true, is if we assume things that imply verity in their very definitio
n (like intrinsic intentionality or dualism).
 Only due to these definitions and dogmatinc settings these things have
 verifying force, making the verifying force circular.
 It is the classic Münchhausen trilemma we are faced with, of course.
 When attempting to justify any argumentation, we have the choice among
 the following three alternatives:

 This, again, applies to coherence, constructivist, consensus, and pragmatic

Adequacy can be proven wrong by means of examples of inadequacy for any

\begin_layout Standard
This is somewhat opposed to putting blind faith in any kind of supreme authority.
 Any such supreme authorities like books or god-like entities that are not

 are highly improbable -- and even if they exist, we cannot possibly know
 which of the various entities that are offered as being the one true supreme
 authority happens to be the correct one.

Strictly speaking, it's rarely the god-like entities that are considered

 seems to give the religious books, the holders of common and accepted memes,
 their perceived normative power.

 On the other hand, I believe

 As soon as rational discussion is used as a means of conviction, it is

 and having more justification than whatever supreme authorities I believe
 in, it cannot be used to convince me otherwise.

 essentially is the postulation of two kinds of essences: A physical, nonthinkin

 thinking essence (which builds the mind).
 Thus, it is the separation of body and mind, and it did not really start

 They all postulate that there is more to the world than the physical, and
 more importantly, they postulate that this additional matter is not traceable

 Looking at the original Cartesian version that puts the

\begin_layout Quote
How, precisely, does the information get transmitted from pineal gland to
 mind? [...] let's ignore those upbound signals for the time being, and concentrate
 on the return signals, the directives from mind to brain.
 These, 
\emph on
ex hypothesi
\emph default
, are not physical [...].
 No physical energy or mass is associated with them.
 How, then, do they get to make a difference to what happens in the brain
 cells they must affect, if the mind is to have any influence over the body?
 A fundamental principle of physics is that any change in the trajectory
 of any physical entity is an acceleration requiring the expenditure of
 energy, and where is this energy to come from?

A hidden form of dualism

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to overtly dualist theories, many recent philosophers still
 have hidden and implicit dualist premises, sometimes of an openly admitted
 intuitive nature, when looking at a world they perceive as naturalist.
 Searle for example posits special causal powers that are not necessarily
 replicable by a formal program.
 His argument is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
I offer no a priori proof that a system of integrated circuit chips couldn't
 have intentionality.
 That is, as I say repeatedly, an empirical question.
 What I do argue is that in order to produce intentionality the system would
 have to duplicate the causal powers of the brain and that simply instantiating
 a formal program would not be sufficient for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
[...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Now I argue at some length that [the circuit chips] couldn't have intentionality
 solely in virtue of instantiating the program.
 Once you see that the program doesn't necessarily add intentionality to
 the system, it then becomes an empirical question which kinds of systems
 really do have intentionality, and the condition necessary for that is
 that they must have causal powers equivalent to those of the brain.

For anyone who has actually undergone that [out-of-body] experience, it

 that conscious experience can, as a matter of fact, take place

Metzinger does not mean to say that every major proponent of dualism has

The cartesian theater
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dennett also tries to and succeeds in finding further fragments of dualism,
 anachronist remainders of dualist ideas.
 One such remainder is the Cartesian Theater.
 It is the idea that there is a central, clearly localizable place of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

meaning happening
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the brain.
 According to that idea, there is a locus of understanding, like a theater
 where everything is presented to an internal audience, the place where
 all the data collected by other mechanisms in the brain comes together
 and 
\emph on
makes sense
\emph default
.
 This would make the understanding of experience a lot easier:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
It seems that if we could say 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 where, we could say exactly when the experience happened.
 And vice versa: If we could say exactly when it happened, we could say
 where in the brain conscious experience was located.

 From a scientific perspective, there is no such clearly definable point

 be a Cartesian Theater of any kind anyway.

\begin_layout Quote
The Cartesian Theater may be a comforting image because it preserves the
 reality/appearance distinction at the heart of human subjectivity, but
 as well as being scientifically unmotivated, this is metaphysically dubious,
 because it creates the bizarre category of the objectively subjective --
 the way things, actually, objectively seem to you even if they don't seem
 to seem that way to you!

These

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 would, of course, correspond to the ways in which content is produced in
 that Cartesian Theater locus, if it were interpreted (by the audience)
 to have another meaning than the presenting mechanisms (the actors) intended.
 In other words, If a meaning changes when the audience interprets the actors'
 play, the way the actors really played constitutes the newly created category
 of the objectively subjective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trouble goes deeper than the quote itself even mentions, as this could
 be interpreted to also require intention, and possibly intentionality,
 on both sides of the Cartesian Theater stage, both in the actors and the
 audience.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A Cartesian Theater where the actors do not have any kind of intentionality
 is thinkable as well.
 That would imply a purely mechanistic approach in regard to the presentation
 mechanisms -- the things presented on the stage would not have any more
 than derived intentionality.
 That derived intentionality would then correspond to the way things actually,
 objectively seem to you.
 Even having just one side require intrinsic intentionality however does
 not solve the problem, it just avoids duplicating the same problem on the
 presenting and the interpreting side of the Cartesian Theater.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The Cartesian Theater, even if it existed, would thus fail to explain anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dennett explains how there really cannot be a Cartesian Theater if we do
 not commit to dualism, and conversely, how if we do not want to commit
 to dualism, we cannot believe that there is a Cartesian Theater:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
When you discard Cartesian dualism, you really must discard the show that
 would have gone on in the Cartesian Theater, and the audience as well,
 for neither the show nor the audience is to be found in the brain, and
 the brain is the only real place there is to look for them.

Supervenience
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Supervenience is an attempt at finding a concept that can explain the apparent
 dualism between mind and body.
 Supervenience as a term was introduced by Donald Davidson:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Although the position I describe denies there are psychophysical laws, it
 is consistent with the view that mental characteristics are in some sense
 dependent, or supervenient, on physical characteristics.
 Such supervenience might be taken to mean that there cannot be two events
 alike in all physical respects but differing in some mental respect, or
 that an object cannot alter in some mental respect without altering in
 some physical respect.
 Dependence or supervenience of this kind does not entail reducibility through
 law or definition; if it did, we could reduce moral properties to descriptive,
 and this there is good reason to 
\emph on
believe
\emph default
 cannot be done; and we might be able to reduce truth in a formal system
 to syntactical properties, and this we 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 cannot in general be done.

Thomas Metzinger on the other hand agrees that it is impracticable to attempt
 to reduce mental events to physical events, but does not say that they
 are irreducible in principle.
 Quite the opposite, he proposes a model that could enable such a reduction:
 functional clusters of neurons,

combining a high internal correlation strength between its elements with
 the existence of distinct functional borders,

 and measurable by means of a cluster index.
 As he writes about such functional clusters,

this island of causal density is constituted by a certain subset of neural
 elements that are strongly coupled among themselves, but only weakly interactiv

I agree with Metzinger's point of view in many respects, and this is one

 Practical irreducibility does not have to be the same as principial irreducibil

 in principle, while we just don't know how to practically do that yet.

Particularly the teleological argumentation that we will see when looking

Selfish genes

\begin_layout Standard
Even though it is not entirely undisputed, I will also adopt Dawkins' view
 on natural selection and evolution not being a purpose in and of itself,
 and animals being mere vehicles that enable the survival of our genes.
 As he writes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
We, and all other animals, are machines created by our genes.
 [...] Our genes have survived, in some cases for millions of years, in a highly
 competitive world.
 [...] I shall argue that a predominant quality to be expected in a successful
 gene is ruthless selfishness.
 This gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual
 behaviour.
 However, as we shall see, there are special circumstances in which a gene
 can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of altruism
 at the level of individual animals.
 [...] Much as we might wish to believe otherwise, universal love and welfare
 of the species as a whole are concepts that simply do not make evolutionary
 sense.

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, animals are essentially selfish, unless altruism benefits
 the survival of its genes.
 In some cases, altruism goes very far: Sometimes, an individual animal
 acting suicidally actually benefits the reproduction of its genes, such
 as when bees die after stinging an enemy of the hive, or birds risk their
 lives to warn the flock of an approaching hawk.
 And in the case of non-trivial symbiotic relationships between species,
 an indivudual's behaviour benefitting another party rather than itself
 can further the chances of survival for the species as well.
 Essentially, selfishness in this sense can even be a form of altruism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that Dawkins did not mean to say that genes are
 selfish in any self-aware sense.
 They merely are selfish in that only those genes survive which are predisposed
 in ways that make them produce forms of life that has high odds of reproduction
, and thus is able to further the population of a particular genotype, and
 produce more of these genes.
 In this sense, only selfish genes survive, while all genes that are not
 selfish probably die.
 So, all genes that survive must be selfish.
 But this does not imply any kind of intrinsic intentionality of genes.

What Consciousness has to do with Evolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both Dennett and Metzinger rightly point out the important role that evolution
 plays when we are looking at consciousness.
 Metzinger explicitly makes teleofunctionalism a background assumption of
 his work,

 while Dennett has an entire chapter on the evolution of consciousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Metzinger:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Teleofunctionalism in the way Metzinger uses it appears to be the following
 assumption, given there is a system that developed in an evolutionary process:
 Every functional property of that system was itself developed in this evolution
ary process, and was selected due to evolutionary fitness in the particular
 niche the system was adapting to.
 So, for every functional property of a system, there was a goal that its
 implementation served, and this goal was in turn beneficial for the reproductio
n of the genotype in question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This view might seem a bit radical, and it finds its culmination in the
 adaptivity constraint that we will look at in chapters 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Adaptivity"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Weaker-Adaptivity"

\end_inset

.
 Personally, I am quite certain that there are mutations and functional
 properties that do not have the teleofunctionalist justification Metzinger
 believes to be a prerequisite -- mutations that are 
\emph on
not detrimental
\emph default
 (as opposed to 
\emph on
strictly beneficial
\emph default
) for a genotype's continued existence can just as well survive reproductive
 and adaptive activity.
 For consciousness itself however, a concept that is very complex and very
 fragile, teleofunctionalism applies to a large extent, and therefore I
 can, and will, adopt it for my thesis.

Dennett:

Only after this happened was there the possibility for conscious awareness
 -- meaning, gathering information for future use.
 This created another problem: There was no captain, so the various volounteers

 action dispositions) had to organize themselves into one stream of thought,
 since the body can only do one thing at a time.

Notably, Dennett does not offer explicit proof or even models for each step,
 but he drafts a reasonable theory on how evolutionary pressure made consciousne
ss what it is today.
 He also notes that while for a long time, evolutionary pressure was the
 driving force behind adaptations of the genome for the new tricks a species
 learned, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the tricks [of consciousness] have so altered the nature of the environment
 for our species that there is no longer significant selection pressure
 calling for further hard-wiring.

In true Wittgensteinian tradition, Minksky points out how often, we seem
 to see problems where there really would not be any if we would just use
 fitting terminology.
\end_layout

The particular problem for Minsky is that in psychology, we often use just
 one word to describe an entire

 He first introduces the term of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

suitcase words
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 already early in his book, asking:

 He then continues and defines them further, saying that

 of very large ranges of different things whose relationships we don't yet

 so many such

The important philosophical lesson we can draw from this is relatively simple:
 We should stay the course after the linguistic turn, and keep questioning
 everything our language implies.
 If this means breaking up tried and treasured concepts, so be it.
 However, Minsky does have a word of caution for us as well:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
I am not suggesting that we should try to dissect and replace all our suitcase-w

 to serve many important purposes -- but also, they often handicap us by
 preserving outdated concepts.

 It is not the case that something is necessarily untrue merely because
 we cannot imagine it to be true.
 We are built a certain way, with certain dispositions that helped us survive
 long enough to be where we are now.
 Those dispositions were (and, most of them, are) adequate for survival,
 and not necessarily insights into reality.

There is a fundamental problem about us looking at what constitutes consciousnes
s, and, in particular, selfhood: The epistemic irreducibility of any conscious
 experience, the fact that it is tied to a first-person perspective, may
 be explainable, but it is not possible to be truly convinced (which is
 necessary to make it intuitively plausible) by such an explanation.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is because either we agree with the possibility and coherence of the
 explanation, but do that from a still experienced phenomenal first-person
 perspective that we cannot drop, thus forming a conflict that cannot be
 resolved without internal contradictions in our belief system.
 Or we abandon the first-person perspective completely in some form of enlighten
ment, but then (even if us humans are able to reach that state) have no
 subject anymore that can be convinced of the truth of any such theory.

An example that shows how evolutionary pressure made intuition just the
 way it is: When a huge grizzly bear comes charging at a caveman, he doesn't
 survive if he takes his time pondering whether he is just imagining or
 dreaming, or whether it's actually a bear after all.
 The cavemen that survive are those who experience phenomenally perceived
 events as immediate and unquestionably real.

This does not imply that I believe that our current scientific theories

 But I believe that scientific theories could in theory be formed that contain
 all the answers, using rational argumentations as their foundation.
 It also means that I believe that some basic principles of science (mostly,
 conclusive logic, causal analysis and semantical coherence) will lead us
 to a better understanding of the world that we have just started to understand.

Reductive naturalism seems to have legitimation even when we look at the
 innermost workings of consciousness, our models of ourselves as thinking
 subjects:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Today, it only seems safe to say two things: Phenomenal content as such
 is not epistemically justified content, and it locally supervenes on brain
 properties.
 A brain in a vat could generate the conscious experience of thinking 
\emph on
[I am certain that I* exist]
\emph default
.
 Cotard's syndrome patients can generate the conscious experience of thinking
 
\emph on
[I am certain that I* do not exist]
\emph default
.
 It is therefore plausible that a minimally sufficient neural correlate
 for the phenomenal content characterizing the specific conscious experience
 of thinking 
\emph on
[I am certain that I* exist]
\emph default
 does exist.

In other words, even when we look at one of the most basic premises, the
 premise that thinking things exist, it is (based on evidence) at least
 very plausible that the experience of that premise is based on physical
 entities, neural correlates.
 While this is of course no proof, it is at least a strong sign that reductive
 naturalism seems to point into the right direction.

My reasons for this are very similar to Dawkins'.
 He clarifies these reasons like this, concerning evolution -- I believe
 the maxim of his thought should hold true for all aspects of our world
 view:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
If all the evidence in the universe turned in favour of creationism, I would
 be the first to admit it, and I would immediately change my mind.
 As things stand, however, all available evidence (and there is a vast amount
 of it) favours evolution.
 It is for this reason and this reason alone that I argue for evolution
 with a passion that matches the passion of those who argue against it.
 My passion is based on evidence.
 Theirs, flying in the face of evidence as it does, is truly fundamentalist.

A word of caution: Of course, evidence is always open to interpretation,
 and even what counts as evidence is open to interpretation as well.
 Wittgenstein explicated this in

 So Dawkin's point of view might be a bit too radical.
 Nevertheless, points of view with more and more convincing evidence overall
 should be given more credit, and to me this seems to be a rational-causalist
 one.
