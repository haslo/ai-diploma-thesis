\begin_layout Part
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we can get to the heart of the matter of what consciousness is all
 about, we need to make sure that we are all on equal footing.
 Often, philosophers use the same terms with diverging meanings.
 Even if I take great care not to talk about Wittgensteinian 
\emph on
Scheinprobleme
\emph default
, it is important to avoid misunderstandings due to linguistic inconsistencies.
 For that end, and for the convenience of readers with less of a philosophical
 background, I will introduce and define the major terms that are important
 for the discussion in the appendix, in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Definitions"

\end_inset

.
 I will also regularly refer to that section when we come across subjects
 or terms that necessitate clarification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us start our journey by finding out what that hard problem is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The hard problem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is generally known as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the hard problem of consciousness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a very fascinating, but also a very disputed matter.
 It is the one thing we do not seem to be able to understand about our brains:
 How does a clump of molecules, a mere mass of gray matter, a network of
 brain cells, produce consciousness?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are four important parts to this question, all of which warrant a
 closer look: First, how does the brain produce phenomenality? What are
 qualia? The most mystifying part: How does subjectivity emerge? Finally,
 what is intentionality? How does it all fit together?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During my search for answers to these questions, I encountered two philosophers
 with interesting proposals: Daniel C.
 Dennett and Thomas Metzinger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
D.
 Dennett's works 
\emph on
Consciousness Explained
\emph default
 (1991) and 
\emph on
The Intentional Stance
\emph default
 (1987) break not only with Cartesian dualism, but also with Husserlian
 phenomenology and its descendants.
 Metzinger published Being No One in 2003 as his first major work in English.
 He tries to reinterpret phenomenological views in a radically new way,
 and ends up even dismissing (at least from ontology in a stricter sense)
 the very thing that seems to be at the core of our subjectivity: the self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both Dennett and Metzinger have a somewhat novel approach to the questions
 at hand, meaning they look at them in an interdisciplinary manner and try
 to verify their findings in the light of recent psychological and neuroscientif
ic research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When looking at subjectivity, which to me seems to be the most miraculous
 achievement of consciousness, I looked beyond philosophical works and found
 Marvin Minsky, a pioneer of artificial intelligence, with his book 
\emph on
The Emotion Machine
\emph default
 from 2006.
 Coming from a computer science background, he has a more pragmatic approach
 than the aforementioned philosophers, and will assist us in our strive
 towards a better overview.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
The goals of this thesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want to focus on how Dennett and Metzinger (and, for subjectivity, Minsky)
 try to answer the four partial questions I mentioned, and present my arguments
 on what I perceive as shortcomings of their theories.
 I will also attempt to combine all of their points of view into one model,
 where possible.
 Furthermore, I want to form a new model, based on the great research they
 provide, that might give a more solid foundation for further research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, I want to provide a short outlook into what the future might hold
 for the philosophy of mind, and its hard problem.

\end_inset

The Four Questions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When facing a really difficult problem, it is often best to break it up
 into smaller, hopefully less difficult problems that can be solved individually
 -- if that is even possible.
 The hard problem of consciousness, the question how it can possibly be
 that our brain, being a mere clump of cells, can develop things like feelings,
 thoughts, plans and fantasies, is one such difficult problem, and it 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 possible to break it up like that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I mentioned before, there really are four major aspects to it.
 These four aspects are in some ways arbitrary -- I have not found another
 such list that satisfied me.
 I do feel however that they are able to encompass all the important parts
 that make up the hard problem, while at the same time being fine-grained
 enough to warrant that we learn something by looking at them a bit more
 in-depth.
 I was inspired by the subjects traditionally chosen by philosophy, and
 ordered them in apparent increasing complexity; one part is meant to the
 the foundation for the next.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, the four subjects cannot be looked at merely in isolation, but
 I will postpone looking at the bigger picture until chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "The-Bigger-Picture"

\end_inset

 -- where we will also abandon these four parts again and look at the hard
 problem from a different perspective, ordering the resulting new parts
 with slight differences from the intuitions that led me to the order in
 this part here, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The partial questions for now thus are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Phenomenality:
\emph default
 The special way things are experienced by agents like us.
 Of course, for a first-person perspective to exist, we do need subjectivity,
 so resolving that apparent circularity is an important part of our look
 at this subject.
 Phenomenality however also is what enables all the other bits and pieces
 we will need in order to understand how consciousness happens.
 What is that phenomenality, and what entities or processes produce it?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Qualia:
\emph default
 The particular non-subdivisable entities of atomic quality we perceive
 when we experience things.
 A passion of many philosophers since Lewis and Nagel; there is a pecularity
 about our experience in that it seems to consist of atomic smallest bits
 of experience that cannot be subdivided any further -- the particular way
 something seems to be irreducibly red or loud to us, for example.
 What is so special about those smallest entities of quality?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Subjectivity:
\emph default
 The way we see everything from a first-person perspective.
 We do experience both ourselves and our fellow humans as persons, and we
 do believe that our fellow humans experience themselves as persons as well.
 How is such a first-person perspective generated, and what else is included
 when you speak of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

myself
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Intentionality:
\emph default
 The world is given to us and we relate to it.
 In introspection, our inner workings are given to us, as seen from a point
 of view that stands in a relation to these inner workings.
 How and why is that so? How comes that we feel we are in direct contact
 with an apple tree in the garden by means of some kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intentional arrow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mental focus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will dedicate a chapter to each of these four parts, defining what really
 is puzzling about them and then looking at possible explanations for their
 origins and constitution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When looking at the four big questions of what phenomenality, qualia, intentiona
lity and subjectivity really are, many philosophers made proposals as to
 what they could be.
 I want to look at two of the most recent proposals, those of Dennett and
 Metzinger.
 Generally, Metzinger digs deeper and develops traditional ideas in entirely
 new ways, while Dennett shows up important counterpoints to those traditional
 views and has a more radically reductionist point of view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, I will also include the proposals of Marvin Minsky (a true
 pioneer of artificial intelligence research) in the chapter about subjectivity.
 Minsky is influenced partially by Dennett, but (being a computer scientist
 and artificial intelligence researcher) comes from a more pragmatic and
 solutions-oriented background, bringing an interesting and fresh point
 of view into the debate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, all three of them have to stand up compared to more traditional
 views -- so I decided to include those in my summary as well:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For 
\emph on
phenomenality
\emph default
, Edmund Husserl's phenomenology pretty much was the origin of the idea,
 and has followers to this very day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For 
\emph on
qualia
\emph default
, we will look at how Clarence Irwing Lewis' introduction of the concept.
 Also, Thomas Nagel might not have named qualia as such, but his work certainly
 was an important multiplier of the idea that something is special about
 subjective experience, so we will briefly look at how he introduces the
 idea as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The traditional view in regards to the origin of 
\emph on
subjectivity
\emph default
 has to be the dualism of René Descartes, which is implicit in many theories
 to this very day, often apparently without the proponents knowing it themselves
 -- as I exemplified in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Dualism"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Concerning 
\emph on
intentionality
\emph default
, Franz Brentano greatly influenced Husserl by fleshing out the traditional
 idea of immanent objectivity in our relationship to the world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, I will add a short consolidatory chapter to all four sections,
 attempting to make sense of which ideas are the most promising for going
 forward from this point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "Phenomenality"

\end_inset

Phenomenality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There seems to be something special about the way we see the world and ourselves
, something that's maybe ineffable, maybe inexplicable or mystical, but
 definitely hard to understand.
 I go ahead and call it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phenomenality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, breaking with Dennett and Searle who include it in the notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intentionality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -- the latter will be redefined in a much narrower way when I look at it
 in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Intentionality"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'd argue that phenomenality in this sense is the most basic thing that
 is special about consciousness, and as such it 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 tempting to just attribute it as a special property to intentionality,
 or to say that what is special about phenomenality is nothing but that
 experience consists of qualia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will try to go another way here, showing what is special about phenomenality
 itself, the special nature in which we (and probably other conscious agents)
 see things, independent of what else there is to consciousness.
 Agreeing with Metzinger, many bits and pieces of the following chapters
 will refer to some event being phenomenal in nature, and here we will find
 out what I mean by that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Husserl: Systematic Reflection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edmund Husserl started a radical paradigmatic shift with his (mostly unpublished
, at least during his lifetime) works.
 He meant to do two things: Approach older concepts on what is mental in
 novel ways, and make subjective experience available for objective study
 through systematic reflection -- standing in Descartes' tradition and taking
 facts gained through introspection at face value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Husserl put great emphasis on intentionality as the prime carrier of phenomenali
ty.
 Unlike Martin Heidegger, who later put a greater emphasis on ontological
 consciousness independent of intentionality (and offering an intuitively
 better explanation for the subconscious, although as we'll see it's not
 necessarily more correct), Husserl put the focus on how we might be able
 to describe our own phenomenal experience, and the immediate way events
 are given to our consciousness.
 Importantly, events are given immediate indeed, but occasionally only partially
 and inadequately -- Husserl agrees that it is perfectly possible to misrepresen
t things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The immediate directedness is given through three parts of an intentional
 act:

I already used this list in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 -- many thanks to Prof.
 E.
 Marbach for the great lectures and seminars, and the fruitful discussions
 that helped me better understand Husserl's approach.
 I hope I do Husserl's work justice in this thesis.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Immanent content, which is raw perceptive data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Intentional content, which is sense, the way the intentional object is intended
 (memory, fantasy, expectance, wish, etc.).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Intentional object, which is the thing the intentional act is directed at
 (in the case of perception, the actual object).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What really makes out phenomenality for Husserl is that all these parts
 have to be given for an event in question, otherwise it's not phenomenal.
 Particularly intentional content is something that intuitively is only
 possible for systems that have true, intrinsic intentionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main criticism that Husserl had and has to face was that his theory
 was too subjectivist.
 However, he never meant to create a subjectivist theory -- but I will save
 this discussion for chapter

\end_inset

Dennet: Heterophenomenology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dennett's heterophenomenology is phenomenology as seen from a third-person
 perspective.
 He defines it like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
I have defended the hypothesis that there is a straightforward, conservative
 extension of objective science that handsomely covers the ground -- 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 the ground -- of human consciousness, doing justice to all the data without
 ever having to abandon the rules and constraints of the experimental method
 that have worked so well in the rest of science.
 This third-person methodology, dubbed heterophenomenology (phenomenology
 of 
\emph on
another
\emph default
 not oneself), is, I have claimed, the sound way to take the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 person point of view as seriously as it can be taken.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Essentially, Dennett defines heterophenomenology mostly by what it's not:
 It's not subjectivist, but intersubjective.
 It's not first-person pilot studies, but third-person scientific research.
 And he claims that everything that would be phenomenology if it were really
 interesting is intersubjectivizable, thus symbolic, and thus not ineffable.
 There is no interesting subsymbolic mental content, or at least, none that
 we could do proper science with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He does put his position into perspective:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
I suspect that when we claim to be just using our powers of inner 
\emph on
observation
\emph default
, we are always actually engaging in a sort of impromptu 
\emph on

 -- and we are remarkably gullible theorizers, precisely because there is
 so little to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

observe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and so much to pontificate about without fear of contradiction.
 [...] Am I saying we have absolutely no privileged access to our conscious
 experience? No, but I am saying that we tend to think we are much more
 immune to error than we are.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the end, it comes down to the following: In heterophenomenology, phenomenolog
ical reports of individual agents are not taken at face value, but as theorist's
 fictions.
 Only after collecting and cataloguing them, looking for similarities and
 differences between different agent's fictions, can a researcher start
 attempting to explain the existence of these heterophenomenological reports.
 According to Dennett, that is all phenomenological reports are good for:
 Collecting data and pointers for later research into the true nature of
 how consciousness happens:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
We organize our data regarding these phenomena into theorist's fictions,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

intentional objects
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in heterophenomenological worlds.
 Then the question of whether items thus portrayed exist as real objects,
 events, and states in the brain -- or in the soul, for that matter -- is
 an empirical matter to investigate.
 If suitable real candidates are uncovered, we can identify them as the
 long-sought referents on the subject's terms; if not, we will have to explain
 why it seems to subjects that these items exist.

Notably, for Dennett, heterophenomenology is not (unlike his notion of tradition
al phenomenology) a research topic, but a methodology.
 Dennett does not seem to enter the discussion as to what it really is that
 makes an agent's experience phenomenal -- as we will see even better in

Metzinger: Multilevel Constraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metzinger proposes a catalogue of multilevel constraints in order to define
 what makes the phenomenal experience of consciousness possible and necessary
 if they apply to any given system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constraints are multilevel in that Metzinger attempts to capture all
 the important levels of description he makes out to be important for consciousn
ess research.

 These include the phenomenological level (gained introspectively, analyzed
 epistemically), the representationalist level (intentional content), the
 informational-computational level (computational function and goal), the
 functional level (purely causal properties independent of physical realization)
 and finally the physical-neurobiological level (direct neural corellates
 in usually human brains).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will not go into all those levels for each constraint, but I will try
 to explain each constraint individually nevertheless, glossing over the
 different levels and starting each constraint's discussion with a quote
 from Metzinger's book.

In fact, I will stay so close to his argumentation overall that I will occasiona
lly even merely paraphrase him.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 I will not argue for the individual constraints here, as that would mostly
 be merely attempting to duplicate Metzinger's fine work.
 We will encounter some of the constraints again later in this thesis however,
 in other contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Important in the context of answering the question what phenomenality is
 however is the chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Levels-of-Consciousness"

\end_inset

, where we will see how Metzinger uses these constraints in order to differentia
te between different levels of phenomenal experience, and how he shows that
 phenomenality is not an all-or-nothing phenomenon.
\end_layout

First, however, I want to introduce two other concepts that Metzinger improves
 our understanding of: Introspection, and how consciousness can't be anything
 but a process.

Metzinger makes it clear that there isn't just trivial introspection.
 Rather, there are varying degrees of introspective access to mental states
 -- which results in phenomenally represented information.

Consciousness as a Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the brain being an information processing machine, mental states cannot
 be states in a traditional, rigid sense.
 Rather, they have to be reformed and reworked all the time through that
 process, in order to be experienced as transtemporally constant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With regards to the first step, representation, the argument is somewhat
 simple:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
The concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mental representation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be analyzed as a three-place relationship between representanda and
 representata with regard to an individual system: Representation is a process
 which achieves the internal depiction of a representandum by generating
 an internal state, which functions as a representatum [...].
 The representandum is the 
\emph on
object
\emph default
 of representation.
 The representatum is the concrete internal 
\emph on
state
\emph default
 carrying information related to this object.
 Representation is a 
\emph on
process
\emph default
 by which the system as a whole generates this state.

 Also, not all entities in the world have to have a representation -- as
 we will see in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Metzinger-Qualia"

\end_inset

, there are presentata just like representata.
 But the biggest issue so far is that the nature of those mental states
 themselves, the representatum, is as dynamic as the nature of the process
 of the mental representation that leads to them.
 Mental states are merely intermediate results of the constant remodeling
 process in which our brains are constantly engaged.

Human brains function in a similar way [to a flight simulator].
 From internally represented information and utilizing continuous input
 supplied by the sensory organs they construct an internal model of external
 reality.
 This global model is a 
\emph on
real-time model
\emph default
; it is being updated at such a great speed and with such reliability that
 in general we are not able to experience it

as

 this kind of mental content that generates the phenomenal experience of

Constraint 1: Global Availability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Phenomenally represented information is precisely that subset of currently
 active information in the system of which it is true that it is globally
 available for deliberately guided attention, cognitive reference, and control
 of action [...].

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The availability is global because every part of consciousness has access
 to them.
 These three are indeed the basic kinds of global availability:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Global availability for deliberately guided attention: In order to inspect
 things more in-depth, we can guide our attention towards certain aspects
 of ourselves or our environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Global availability for cognitive reference: We can think about things,
 we can form mental concepts of them, we can put them into relations with
 past experiences or plan actions involving them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Global availability for control of action: We can catch incoming balls,
 push buttons when stimuli occur, and also can act according to plans we
 have formed beforehand (that are then globally available as well).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to these, speech control, autobiographical memory, phenomenal
 cognition and others are mentioned in the text -- all of which are merely
 subcategories of the more basic three kinds however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every such availability will likely have different neural correlates, but
 their whole is experienced as embedded into one whole world model and available
 to processes of consciousness anyway.
 The world model is all there is for a conscious mind, and its boundaries
 are the boundaries of the agent's reality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metzinger notes that important points about global availability are flexibility,
 selectivity of content, and a certain degree of autonomy.

 This makes the large number of specialized modules our brain has able to
 interact with those phenomenal states that are globally available -- and
 vice versa, it provides an interface to many modules for new such phenomenal
 states that enter the system's world model.
 This allows the system to react flexibly and quickly to new threats and
 challenges from its environment.

 reference and concept formation (more about this when we talk about qualia

Constraint 2: Activation within a Window of Presence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
The experience of presence coming with our phenomenal model of reality may
 be the central aspect [...]: It is, as it were, the temporal immediacy of
 existence

 If we subtract the global characteristic of presence from the phenomenal
 world-model, then we simply subtract its existence.

For human beings, the concept of Now has a culturally invariant duration
 of maximally three seconds, so there must be biological reasons for that

 merely creates

This is the general case of constraint 1, global availability.
 Only if there is a coherent global state can there be something that is
 available within that coherent global state.

, and that is pretty much what Descartes describes with the concept of indivisib
ility, the unity of consciousness.
 We aren't aware that it is only a model, a representation (more on this
 yet again when we talk about transparency in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 Yet we experience the world as a lived real whole, with the building blocks
 not being elements, but parts with a multitude of part-whole relations
 of that reality.
 And, the world we live in is completely indistinguishable from one moment
 to the next and thus experienced as being always the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having just one single world model is a pretty efficient way of reducing
 chaos from incoming sensory data, reducing ambiguity, with the side effect
 of also reducing data and thus computational load.
 This is supported by empirical evidence: If two sources of contradictory
 information are made available to a human through different sensory channels,

\begin_layout Standard
It is necessary for convolved holism to be possible at all that we do have
 one all-encompassing world model, and we experience all those parts and
 wholes as being in the phenomenal Now, so constraints 2 and 3 are prerequisites
 for convolved holism -- one could even say that convolved holism is a natural
 extension of the coherent global state.
 On the other hand, it is perfectly thinkable for a system to have a whole
 world model that is not partitioned at all, not even into the self-world
 distinction that is so important for us humans.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same set of part-whole relations of course applies to causal contexts
 in our environment, which makes convolved holism a functionally very adequate
 solution for the requirement that systems have to be able to react quickly
 to small shifts in their perception of their environment, or even themselves
 -- so introspection is essentially nothing but a special kind of experienced
 convolved holism.

\begin_layout Standard
When convolved holism was a natural extension of the coherent global state,
 dynamicity is a natural extension of the presentationality constraint,
 constraint 2.
 If we have a phenomenal, temporal Now, we can easily perceive of past and
 future Nows.
 This must not necessarily be the case for a system, but if it is, it allows
 for phenomenal concepts of duration and change, and generally perception
 of the flow of time.
 The concept is not easy to grasp, and Metzinger has to resort to analogies:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
It is not as if you see the clouds drifting through a window, the window
 of the Now.
 There is no window frame.
 It is not as if the Now would be an island emerging in a river, in the
 continuous flow of consciously experienced events, as it were -- in a strange
 way the island is a 
\emph on
part
\emph default
 of the river itself.

The subjective experience of time is dependent on attention and representational
 content, but the core issue with time perception seems to be duration,
 permanence, the transtemporal identity of objects for the system.
 Everything else that we experience is always perceived as being a property
 of such experientally presented, dynamical objects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not easy to form a concept beyond this, and intuitions seem to differ
 widely.
 Steps leading to a lower-level representational explanation of this concept
 would include finding how events are individuated, then finding how patterns
 and sequences of such events are formed.
 Already those two steps are controversial however, and Metzinger surrenders
 when faced with the aforementioned transtemporal identity problem.

\begin_layout Quotation
In order to meet this constraint, one needs a detailed and empirically plausible
 theory of how a system can internally represent itself 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld

first-person perspective
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by philosophers can emerge in a naturally evolved information-processing
 system.
 Subjectivity, viewed as a phenomenon located on the level of phenomenal
 experience, can only be understood if we find comprehensive theoretical
 answers to the following two questions.
 First, what is a consciously experienced, phenomenal 
\emph on
self
\emph default
? Second, what is a consciously experienced phenomenal 
\emph on
first-person perspective
\emph default

Metzinger does point out how this is among the most interesting phenomena
 when it comes to phenomenology, and I'm tempted to agree.
 It was among the chief things that made me read Metzinger's work after
 having been disappointed when it comes to exactly what subjectivity actually
 is after reading Dennett -- the latter merely glosses over the functional
 aspect of this interesting point (as we'll see in chapter

The phenomenology of being someone, of consciously experienced selfhood.
 Part of this is what the phenomenal self-model that we will look at in
 chapter

 is all about; 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

it is a subjectively immediate and fundamental form of nonconceptual self-knowle
dge preceding any higher forms of

A self-model (potentially being both cognitive and conceptual) necessarily

 as we will see in chapter

 This proto-self is the other part of this phenomenology of being someone,

There is an epistemic asymmetry that only appears on this level of representatio

 to explain why it is epistemically irreducible -- a point where Dennett
 would probably disagree, since he does not believe in irreducibility in
 any form.

Transparency [...] is a property of active mental representations already satisfyin

 [...] The second defining characteristic postulates that what makes them transpare
nt is the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
[...] For any phenomenal state, the degree of phenomenal transparency is inversely
 proportional to the introspective degree of attentional availability of
 earlier processing stages.

\begin_layout Standard
Metzinger's definition of transparency is different from other philosophers'
 definitions.
 The standard definition only defines that vehicle properties of certain
 mental states are not available for introspection whereas content properties
 are.
 But as Metzinger points out, there clearly are cases where what formerly
 were vehicle properties (not physical vehicle properties, but for example
 thoughts or emotions) can become opaque and are available for introspection
 as well.
 There are different degrees of transparency according to how much of those
 vehicle properties is currently available for introspection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore, vehicle and content are not as easily distinguishable as it
 seems, but are rather different aspects of the same ongoing process --
 so attempting to split them apart bears 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

subtle residues of Cartesian dualism

, which makes definitions of transparency using those terms of vehicle and
 content less desirable.
 As Metzinger writes,

for every kind of phenomenal content in humans there will be at least one

\begin_layout Enumerate
Transparency is a phenomenological concept, not an epistemological notion.
 So it is possible to be wrong about one's own mental contents; In fact,
 that happens rather often in pathological cases.
 It's however not possible to be aware of all of one's own faults when thinking
 about one's own consciousness, exactly because the core processes are hidden
 from introspection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Phenomenal transparency is subsymbolic and used as a concept in philosophical
 neurophenomenology, not as a part of formal semantics.
 As such it can exist in nonlinguistic creatures and is not a property of
 context nor referential in an ontological sense.
 Any conscious being can have (and probably has, because transparency will
 end up being a prerequisite for phenomenality in chapter

Transparency does seem to imply the existence of the entities represented.
 This leads to the fact that a naive realism concerning those entities is
 intuitively very attractive for us humans by necessity -- as it is the
 way we experience the world.
 We don't see what we're looking through, the medium that the experience
 takes place in is indetectable for introspective access.

 The opposite of transparent states would then be opaque ones -- they are
 the ones where darkness is made explicit, where we represent that something
 is merely a representation, for example in lucid dreams or obvious hallucinatio

 we plan or imagine or remember.

What is not possible however is that there is no analogue representation
 of a certain stimulus, for biological reasons: Stimuli are perceived through
 physical sensors that detect certain modal qualities along with their intensiti
es.
 Not detecting something (for example, no light in a dark room) merely has
 the associated sensors detect an intensity of zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since intensity directly infers signal strength, it is highly adaptive for
 an organism to make those detected intensities globally available, too,

However, as Metzinger points out, the entire area in question appears as
 directly given, it can well be called atomic itself and not further divisible.
 As soon as we start thinking about subregions, the concept of those subregions
 forms (they are relative to the curently employed representational architecture
), but before that, there just is the entirely transparent concept of the
 simple, ultrasmooth, representationally atomic, one-color surface.

The underlying issue is that artificial systems do not require any teleofunction
alist properties; their goals and ideals (or rather, the corresponding represent
ative mental states) don't necessarily have to make sense.
 Here is one of the reasons why I stressed the importance of evolution in
 chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Evolution"

\end_inset

: Evolution sees to it that the development of goal states that are detrimental
 to an organism's reproduction do not enter the common gene pool of that
 species.
 In other words, goal states in real intelligence do necessarily make sense.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is true at least most of the time and if seen in a bigger context.
 Of course, the rapid secondary and tertiary evolution (through the replication
 of memes and temes) that we are now going through (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Dawkins1976"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Blackmore2008"

\end_inset

) makes some of the goal states that were a result of genetic evolution
 occasionally outdated.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Emotions then are the expression of those goal states in human beings.
 Being attracted to a member of the opposite sex (as a trivial example)
 is beneficial for reproduction.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
That doesn't make being attracted to your own sex any less probable or desirable
 from a moral or ethical point of view.
 Genetic dispositions to that end will however necessarily always remain
 in the minority, as individuals that exhibit them are less likely to reproduce.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This, by the way, should in no way trivialize the what-is-it-likeness of
 emotions.
 I merely mean to exemplify their functional role for the survival of a
 species, as normative value functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar arguments apply to consciousness and phenomenal states in general,
 although the benefits always have to be weighed up (and brutally and remorseles
sly 
\emph on
are
\emph default
 weighed up in evolutionary processes) against their downsides, like the
 larger brain that makes human childbirth more stressful (and potentially
 lethal for both mother and child) than that of other animals.
 If large brains thus are to prevail, they need to have other benefits that
 weigh up those shortcomings, or they will not stand up to evolutionary
 pressure.
 And of course, there is such a benefit: Consciousness increases the odds
 of survival of a particular species, because it increases flexibility and
 adaptivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Consciousness, first, is an instrument to generate successful behavior;
 like the nervous system itself it is a device that evolved for motor control
 and sensorimotor integration.
 Different forms of phenomenal content are answers to different problems
 which organisms were confronted with in the course of their evolution.
 Color vision solves another class of problems than the conscious experience
 of one's own emotion, because it makes another kind of information available
 for flexible control of action.

 is, but admits what I think is important in this context:

Every resultant is either a sum or a difference of the co-operant forces;
 their sum, when their directions are the same -- their difference, when
 their directions are contrary.
 Further, every resultant is clearly traceable in its components, because
 these are homogeneous and commensurable.
 It is otherwise with emergents, when, instead of adding measurable motion
 to measurable motion, or things of one kind to other individuals of their
 kind, there is a co-operation of things of unlike kinds.
 The emergent is unlike its components insofar as these are incommensurable,

 Global availability (1) -- although since this is a special case of the

Homogeneity of simple content (10) is interesting, because as we found out
 it is, for systems like us humans, a prerequisite for proper concept formation
 and thus necessary at least for episodic memory and forward planning that
 cognitive, subjective consciousness introduces.
 It might even be necessary for convolved holism; how can a mind form a
 concept of wholes if it is not able to conceive of its contents as homogenous?
 I think I would add this constraint as a requirement for differentiated
 consciousness already.

Ineffability then comes naturally with the combination of at least perspectivaln

Phenomenality, just like consciousness, is not an all-or-nothing attribute
 of systems.
 It seems to me that the extent to which a system's states (or rather, processes

 of consciousness it exhibits, and thus analogous to the number and nature
 of multilevel constraints it satisfies.

We saw in chapter

 what Dennett's biggest gripe with traditional phenomenology is: It is not
 necessarily intersubjective.
 He makes this rather explicit:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Lone-wolf autophenomenology, in which the subject and experimenter are one

 it isn’t science until you turn your self-administered pilot studies into

However, I am not sure if Dennett's position is really so different from
 Husserl's when it comes to what is science and what isn't.
 Maybe Heidegger's continuation of Husserl's theories, putting way more
 focus on how phenomenality is a subjective phenomenon, would fall victim
 to this argument of Dennett's.
 Husserl however would probably even agree with him:
\end_layout

It is absolutely clear; scientific conclusions regarding phenomena are not
 feasible after phenomenologic reduction, in particular if we conceptually
 define those phenomena as absolutely distinct and unique.
 Only if we enter the empirical-psychological sphere, if we look at the
 phenomena as experiences of an experiencing self that is in an interrelation
 with nature, can we conceptualize [what scientific conclusions we can reach]
 in a similar way to how psychologists do it in experimental practice.

So individual phenomenal experiences only gain a scientific meaning if they
 are also looked at in the context that the subject experiencing them was
 in -- and, it is important that empirical research includes not only individual

 of them, preferrably from multiple subjects or at least from the same subject
 reproducibly experienced.

What the referenced object actually is is not topic of our research; it

\begin_layout Standard
So, considering these passages from Husserl, I am uncertain as to what it
 is that actually makes heterophenomenology so different from phenomenology.
 Both Dennett and Husserl agree that we have some (more or less limited)
 privileged access to our mental states.
 They both agree that proper scientific research can only be performed from
 a third-person, intersubjective point of view, taking phenomenological
 accounts not at face value and forming theories as to what it is that makes
 agents have those particular phenomenal experiences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Considering neither of them actually offers more insight into what phenomenal
 experience itself is however, I want to leave this side scene, and will
 for the remainder of this thesis focus on Metzinger's more thorough theory
 of the genesis of phenomenality.
 After all, he actually did what both Dennett and Husserl proposed: He tried
 to model how agents get to make autophenomenological reports in the first
 place.

 Minsky agrees with him in that things certainly

\begin_layout Quotation
[In the Global Workspace theory] The theater becomes a workspace to which
 the entire audience of “experts” has potential access ...
 Awareness, at any moment, corresponds to the pattern of activity produced
 by the then most active coalition of experts, or modular processors.
 ...
 At any one moment, some may be dozing in their seats, others busy on stage
 ...
 [but] each can potentially contribute to the direction the play takes.
 ...
 Each expert has a “vote”, and by forming coalitions with other experts
 can contribute to deciding which inputs receive immediate attention and
 which are “sent back to committee”.
 Most of the work of this deliberative body is done outside the workspace
 (i.e., non- consciously).
 Only matters of central import gain access to center stage.

However, we cannot push global availability too far:

\begin_layout Quotation
How could such machines [such as individually unique human brains] work
 reliably, in spite of so much variety [in terms of environmental and self-model
ing]? To explain this, quite a few thinkers have argued that our brains
 must be based on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

holistic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 principles, according to which every fragment of process or knowledge is
 “globally distributed” (in some unknown way) so that the system's behavior
 would still be the same in spite of the loss of some of its parts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
However, [I] suggest that we do not need any such magical tricks -- because
 we have so many different ways to accomplish any type of job.
 Also, it makes sense to suppose that many parts of our brains evolved as
 ways to correct (or to suppress) the effects of defects in other parts.

\begin_layout Standard
So while it certainly may 
\emph on
seem
\emph default
 like we have everything globally available, what in fact happens is that
 sensory inputs are processed in parallel by a wide variety of processes,
 and many brain centers (that Minsky calls “critics” and “experts,” but
 unfortunately we do not have the space to look at these more in-depth)
 have access to parts of these processes and can potentially further process
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this is neither magical nor entirely global, but rather, what brain
 centers have access to what processes is stored in the dynamical hardware
\begin_inset Foot

I use “dynamical hardware” here due to a distinct lack of a better term

 of the brain.
 I say this without claiming that domain borders between different processes
 can't be crossed -- quite the opposite, that possibility is indeed (as
 Metzinger claims) one of the prime advantages of our kind of consciousness.
 Rather, these domain borders can only be crossed in certain ways that are
 predetermined in the same dynamical hardware that implements the processes
 themselves.
\end_layout

The Trouble With Perspectivalness

Metzinger's perspectivalness constraint (constraint 6) seems to be fairly
 straightforward.
 It is a first-person point of view that is nonconceptual, happens before
 cognitive processing, it is automatic and requires no effort whatsoever.
 It consists of a nonconceptual prereflexive proto self-consciousness, a
 PSM

 If the prereflexive proto-self is there, we will be able to naturally reach
 the agreement that a full-fledged self-model has to arise from the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, such a proto self-consciousness is everything but trivial and not
 that straightforward after all.
 What is it exactly that we are prereflexively, nonconceptually, aware of?
 It cannot be a self-model, or it would require itself in an infinite regress.
 There is some basic form of perspectivalness that is given for all of today's
 known conscious systems in that they are all spatially confined to a relatively
 small area, and perceive all of their surroundings via a single viewpoint.
 Is there more to perspectivalness than that? Can that be enough to give
 rise to a full-fledged self-model later on?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I have no solution to offer to this, and I guess it will require empirical

 When lightning strikes the tree, Davidson is disintegrated, and by pure
 coincidence the tree is turned into an exact physical replica of Davidson
 (including brain with current neural state and everything).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of that thought experiment is showing that an exact replica of
 a human being might move, think, talk, and argue just as the original,
 it might even have the exact same kind of phenomenality.
 But what it lacks is the original Davidson's intentional content -- Metzinger
 writes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
[...] for instance, it has many false memories about its own history be they
 as conscious as they may.
 The active phenomenal representations in Swampman's brain would [...] 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 satisfy the adaptivity constraint, because these states would have the
 wrong kind of history.
 They did not originate from a process of millions of years of evolution.
 [...] It would [...] still be consciousness in a weaker sense, because it does
 not satisfy the adaptivity constraint [...].

 every subsequent generation of humans would be less conscious than the
 former: After all, much of what we act and live by is not genetically hardcoded
, but rather learned and perceived; it does not have the right kind of history
 built-in.
 All those things that we take as signs of proper intelligence beyond basic
 empathy (including being able to play chess, to talk with each other in
 a common language, to read and write) do not have this kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 system-internal history -- they were introduced from the outside, from
 our parents and teachers, our environment, our experiences.
 And that is the very thing Metzinger tells us is what is wrong with a hypotheti
cal postbiotic intelligence -- even if it were built from actual organic
 tissue, and even if it had gone through an evolutionary process of its
 own:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
[...] it would still follow that these postbiotic phenomenal systems would
 only be conscious in a slightly weaker sense than human beings, because
 human beings were necessary to trigger the second-level evolutionary process
 from which these beings were able to develop their own phenomenal dynamics.
 From a human perspective, just like Swampman, they might not possess the
 right kind of history to count as maximally conscious agents.

A Weaker Adaptivity Constraint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When Metzinger formulated his adaptivity constraint, he seems to have been
 mainly driven by one of his background assumptions, one that he explicitly
 states at the very beginning of his book: Teleofunctionalism.
\begin_inset Foot

 He introduces his commitment like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
[...] representata have been specified by an additional 
\emph on
teleological
\emph default
 criterion: an internal state 
\emph on
X
\emph default
 represents a part of the world 
\emph on
Y for
\emph default
 a system 
\emph on
S
\emph default
.
 This means that the respective physical state within the system only possesses
 its representational content in the context of the history, the goals,
 and the behavioural possibilities of this particular system.
 This context, for instance, can be of social or evolutionary nature.
 [...] It is for this reason that we can always look at mental states with
 representational content as instruments or weapons.
 If one analyzes active mental representata as internal tools, which are
 currently used by certain systems in order to achieve certain goals, then
 one has become a teleofunctionalist or a teleorepresentationalist.

Teleology may not be the best approach for everything (and in fact, when
 Sehon used it along with the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

supervenience
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that Metzinger also uses, he constructed a theory that I can't find myself
 agreeing with at all).
 But when Metzinger uses it, he seems to mean that he looks at the things
 our brains do in a way that assumes they must be good for something --
 because if they weren't, they wouldn't have been a fitness criterion for
 evolution, and consequently wouldn't have survived the last few million
 years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I do agree with that.
 I do not agree with million years of evolution being a necessary prerequisite
 for something being a fitness criterion however, nor do I agree with the
 assumption that merely because a fit system has been duplicated (as Davidson's
 Swampman was) it suddenly loses some kind of metaphysical fitness 
\emph on
pre
\emph default
condition.
 But that is exactly what Metzinger's reading of the adaptivity constraint
 presupposes: That there is some secret ingredient to proper intentionality
 after all, a ghost in the machine reminescent of dualist theories despite
 all our efforts to banish it.
\begin_inset Foot

I do not deny the importance of evolution for today's kind of intelligence.
 It was essential, both as a driving force and a shaping constraint.
 However, even from a purely teleofunctionalist point of view, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

proper history
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 cannot be a criterion for the degree of intentionality a system has.

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 indicators) or qualia -- and as such, I'd like to propose a weaker form
 of Metzinger's adaptivity constraint.
 While an organism may pursue the goals of its ancestors, while this may
 be important for all of today's biological sentient systems (including
 humans), it is not necessary for proper consciousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Essentially, I want to take Metzinger's normative approach to what good
 representata are and slightly alter it.
 It is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Phenomenal representata are 
\emph on
good
\emph default
 representata if, and only if they successfully and reliably depict those
 causal proerties of the interaction domain of an organism that were important
 for reproductive success.

And, the change I propose is simple:

 Those premises were:

Mental objects are immaterial
\begin_inset Quotes erd

Mental objects can be directed at objects in the world

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 via physically analyzable pathways, for example light that hits light-detecting
 nerve cells in the eye), we can causally analyze their interdependence,
 and form models of this directedness, because the kinds that are now directed
 at each other are of the same kind.

 Husserl realized that there is a cognitive closure, that we cannot perceive
 what Metzinger would call transparent properties of mental events.
 Husserl merely didn't attempt to look behind what is introspectively accessable
 because he thought there would be no point in attempting to explain something
 where we do not even know what the explanandum itself is.
 And he did not attempt to form an ontological theory, but rather an epistemolog
ically plausible one.

I do believe that neurological and psychological research has brought us
 to a point where that explanandum becomes at least a little bit less umbral.

what is it like

 Opinions on what exactly this structure is, and how to best research it,
 widely differ.
 What is common to all notions of qualia are that they are among the most
 basic available bits of epistemic knowledge when it comes to conscousness,
 and that they seem to be indivisible from a first-person point of view.
\end_layout

Examples are distinct shades of red and green in a picture we look at, or
 the specific nature of the sound of a piano, or the particular way a glass

 sunlight is cast through treetops in a forest.
 Dennett makes an example of the plethora of qualia that we can experience
 and enjoy.
 He later deconstructs this example, but I find it to be a rather good descripti

Green-golden sunlight was streaming in the window that early spring day,
 and the thousands of branches and twigs of the maple tree in the yard were

 The windowpane is made of old glass, and has a scarcely detectable wrinkle
 line in it, and as I rocked back and forth [in my rocking chair], this
 imperfection in the glass caused a wave of synchronized wiggles to march
 back and forth across the delta of branches, a regular motion superimposed
 with remarkable vividness on the more chaotic shimmer of the twigs and
 branches in the breeze.

Lewis: Introducing Qualia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clarence Irving Lewis introduced qualia as maximally simple forms of sensory
 content like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
In any presentation, this content is either a specific quale (such as the
 immediacy of redness or loudness) or something analyzable into a complex
 of such.
 The presentation as an event is, of course, unique, but the qualia which
 make it up are not.
 They are recognizable from one to another experience.
 [...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
What any concept denotes -- or any adjective such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

red
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

round
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 -- is something more complex than an identifiable sense-quale.
 In particular, the object of the concept must always have a time-span which
 extends beyond the specious present; this is essential to the cognitive
 significance of concepts.
 The qualia of sense as something given do not, in the nature of the case,
 have such temporal spread.
 Moreover, such qualia, though repeatable in experience and intrinsically
 recognizable, have no names.
 They are fundamentally different from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

universals
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of logic and of traditional problems concerning these.

Qualia are recognizable and thus also categorizable -- but they are not
 determinate concepts just yet.
 There is however a correlation between qualia as categorizable perceptual
 content and determinate concepts.
 That correlation is both potentially different from one situation to the
 next (when different aspects of a concept are in focus) and different from
 one person to another, but qualia are reliably graspable in such determinate
 concepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Epistemically, it is not possible to be mistaken about qualia, we always
 do know which qualia we experience.
 However, it is possible that the concepts the experienced qualia relate
 to are wrong and (while part of our world model) not part of the external
 world.

It is well worth noting that Nagel was not anti-physicalist, nor anti-reductioni

at the present time the status of physicalism is similar to that which the
 hypothesis that matter is energy would have had if uttered by a pre-Socratic

 (Citation from

 imagine how moving away from the specificially first-person way of experiencing
 things can get us any closer to how that specificially first-person way
 of experiencing things happens.
 I do believe that it is possible to explain this on a functional level,
 as well as through neurophysiology that Nagel himself admitted faces no
 such obstacles.
 Nevertheless we indeed do face obstacles right now, because in our current
 position, we have to rely on empathy for emulation and proper appreciation

 Yet if I try to imagine this, I am restricted to the resources of my own

 I cannot perform it either by imagining additions to my present experience,
 or by imagining segments gradually subtracted from it, or by imagining
 some combination of additions, subtractions, and modifications.

 This is not only true for things that happened days or months ago, but
 sometimes we even seem to have experienced them different from how they
 actually and observably happened, right after the fact, or even seemingly
 in the act of perceiving them.
 One example of the many he puts forth is how subjects seem to experience
 taps within 1-3 seconds, in only three distinct places (wrist, elbow and
 upper arm) on one of their arms, as if a small animal was continuously
 walking up that arm:

This leads to all kinds of things that seem oddly inconsistent at first
 sight, but are perfectly rational from a multiple drafts point of view.
 Looking at these processes as a continuous stream from sensory input to
 eventual dissolving (or storage in long-term memory), he points out:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Probing this stream at different places and times produces different effects,
 precipates different narratives from the subject.
 If one delays the probe too long [...], the result is apt to be no narrative
 left at all -- or else a narrative that has been digested or

 If one probes

 one might gather data on how early a particular discrimination is achieved

 supposing that there must be a single narrative [...] that is canonical --

 with experiments.
 Judgements can be distinguished between

An important point is that feature detectors that make us experience something
 as “blue” or “bitter” co-evolved with the features they detect.
 Color vision evolved because there were features distinguishable by colour,

 a butterfly's wings have the same blue as cobalt does is mere coincidence.

This doesn't explain the particular way things feel for us.
 The common term that describes what makes this feeling special seems to
 be “enjoy” -- it stresses the difference between neuroanatomy and experience,
 between information and qualia.
 Qualia (the ones Dennett doesn't support) cannot be divided into mechanical
 parts, while mere information can be split up without losing anything.
 Dennett believes that Qualia don't exist insofar as that there are no such
 irreducible basic entities of experience.

To prove that these differences between the individual experiences of different
 people are explainable in their entirety, Dennett proposes another thought

 other advances in the meantime.
 He goes to claim:
\end_layout

If we want, we can carefully list the differences between our dispositions

 by comparing the lists, come to appreciate, in whatever detail we want,

 and what it is like to be us.

Another interesting point is how inverted qualia don't seem to exist: People
 who wear goggles that turn the world upside down (all the time) adapt to
 that after some time, and are able to ski downhill or drive bicycles through
 city traffic.
 Asked whether they have adapted to their experiential world being upside
 down, or whether they are mentally turning it right side up again, subjects
 answer that this is not the right question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As Dennett points out, this is perfectly in line with the multiple drafts
 model in that multiple places in the brain will have different views on
 that question, and some (like shape or color detection mechanisms) are
 completely independent of the orientation of the environment, while others
 (like ducking the right way when something is thrown at you) will probably
 take much longer to adapt than regular orientation and navigation.
 Parts of the brain will necessarily disagree with each other whether it's
 adaptation or mental content modification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Essentially, Dennett's position boils down to this: It is, at least in theory,
 possible to describe any experience in its entirety, and that description
 is all there is to the experience.
 As such, qualia are just one (fully reducible) abstraction of that description,
 and are superfluous in that they are not an entity that would be a necessary
 part of our arsenal for investigating consciousness.

Metzinger: Phenomenal Presentational Content

Metzinger, like Dennett, doesn't believe that the classical concept of qualia

 phenomenal experiences -- do not exist.”

 Judgements about qualia cannot be false, because they are defined through
 the subjective determination that judges them.

 to find out how we could go about individuating these most simple forms
 in the first place -- and already this stage of the project fails.
 While we can certainly distinguish two particular, just noticeably different
 shades of red when faced with them (they are available for attention),
 we cannot identify or recognize them transtemporally.

Obviously, there is a decline in as how real events are perceived from one
 to the next of these kinds of qualia -- Raffman qualia are less real than
 Lewis qualia, and Metzinger qualia are even less real than Raffman qualia.
 Nevertheless, there are examples for all three kinds; examples of Metzinger
 qualia (that would be immediately destroyed if the subject were to report
 them, since that would require making them available for motor control)
 are “highly abstract forms of consciously experienced mental content, as
 they sometimes appear in the minds of mathematicians and philosophers.”

Phenomenal Presentational Content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Presentational content is nonconceptual, cognitively unavailable, homogenous
 and fully transparent.
 This is what it means that it appears to be ineffable.
 It also supervenes on internal physical and functional properties, like
 any other form of mental content.
 Metzinger offers presentational content as a followup concept for qualia,
 or rather, a concept that is able to explain what seems to be so special
 about qualia, while it is always incorporated into a higher-order whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Phenomenal presentational content then is experienced from a first-person
 point of view, but it is important to realize that this can't mean that
 it is presented to an entity (say, a homunculus).
 It is also not simply property exemplification -- because that would already
 imply that those properties could be compared to each other, they would
 require transtemporal and logical identity criteria.

This is a rather mathematical description.
 However, the idea that qualia as such don't exist, but rather every recognizabl
e quale corresponds to a (non-divisible by introspection) volume in quality
 space, does make sense and also takes into account that there certainly
 are differently wide or narrow interpretations of, for example, redness.
 That quality space then is continuously regenerated in a dynamical process,
 and no actual entities are generated - rather, ceteris paribus, always
 the same input drives always the same presentational processes (that are
 then experienced as always the same objects being perceived in the same
 ways).

For Metzinger, the approach (and particularly the order of the chapters)
 I took here is the wrong way around.
 It is not phenomenality that enables the perception of qualia, but rather,
 presentational content (which can be experienced as qualia) is the foundation
 of phenomenality.

\begin_layout Subsection
Consolidation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Qualia were a somewhat diffuse topic when they were first introduced, and
 they haven't gotten that much clearer since.
 Dennett felt this was sufficient to totally abandon the term, while Metzinger
 on the other hand gives them ontological legitimation, while still attempting
 to analyze them and saying that there is nothing atomical about them --
 they are mostly merely paradigmatic definitions of arbitrary abstraction.
 Let us look closer at how exactly their views differ.
 They both share some similarities:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Both concepts of qualia are in principle reducible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Both concepts of qualia have distinct ways things seem to feel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there are important differences between their theories.
 The most striking ones:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dennett abandons the term “qualia” altogether, while Metzinger gives the
 term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

qualia
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 an ontological legimitation, namely, that of a specific categorizable and
 transtermporally comparable volume in quality space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Dennett's concept of what traditional qualia are is (in addition to reducibility
 in principle) also practically reducible into purely syntactical terms,
 stating that phenomenological descriptions can always be intersubjectively
 specified and conceptualized.
 Metzinger on the other hand, in addition to Dennett's intersubjectivizable
 entities, postulates that there is transparent presentational content,
 subsymbolic and non-categorizable, that can't be intersubjectively specified
 or conceptualized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metzinger does allow an intersubjective view at qualia, and even presentational
 content: By means of the neural correlates they supervene on, and their
 functional role.
 However, the specific what-is-it-like-ness is only available from the first
 person point of view.
 Dennett on the other hand says that all such experiential content is not
 only intersubjectivizable, but understandable in its entirety by any other
 conscious system, even if it has completely different dispositions and
 experiential contents.

The Difference Between Appreciation and Description
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Essentially, Dennett postulates that appreciation (a word he even uses himself,
 see chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Dennett-Disqualifying-Qualia"

\end_inset

) is the same as understanding a description -- that a description is able
 to grasp all aspects of an experiential content, and that reading such
 a description enables a conscious system to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

relive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (which is the proper way to read 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

appreciate,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I believe) those contents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dennett disagrees with Nagel and believes that it would be perfectly possible
 for us to know what it is like to be a bat.
 This implies that both the description can completely capture the experience,
 and that reliving based on such a complete description is possible.
 Let us look at the citation from chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 and what it is like to be us.

I'm not sure I can agree with Dennett.
 Metzinger's view looks much more reasonable to me.
 There simply is mental content that is available for attention, but not
 concept formation.
 And that mental content itself cannot be made intersubjectively available
 -- the best we can ever hope to achieve is to map which neural correlates
 the ones it supervenes on are.

 it would be to have exactly the same neural correlates activated in the

 the one reliving the content, as otherwise, at least some of the (many

 identified in feeling than it is with some stranger's living child today.
 [...] It is the same with certain of our dimly recollected experiences.
 We hardly know whether to appropriate them or to disown them as fancies,

Dennett's Multiple Drafts and Qualia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dennett's multiple drafts model seems to be a pretty adequate description
 of what happens in the brain, and really is a replacement for cartesian
 theaters.
 It takes the massive distributed parallelism in our brains into account,
 and computational models based on it (or rather, based on the same thoughts
 and paradigms) do live up to what we expect from them -- a great example
 is Watt's research into auditory pathways,

 where intermediate representations are reliably constructed and multiple
 versions of the data are available for further processing (that, in his
 case, consists of visualization and probably logging).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dennett does however also present his model of multiple drafts as an alternative
 to the traditional theories of qualia.
 Let us look at how exactly it is an alternative that can explain the same
 things however, and whether the theory of multiple drafts necessarily implies
 that there are no (non-eliminable) qualia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make the transition from qualia to the theory of multiple drafts,
 Dennett first observes that one of the prime motivations behind the concept
 of qualia was that the entities that qualia would have to be would only
 be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in the eye and brain of the beholder,

 not out there in the world ready for us to observe.
 But, if they are in our brains, there is no inner figment that they are
 made of either; Dennett straight out denies that things like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

occurrent pink
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would need to be included in popular science -- because unlike Sellars,

 Dennett (just like Metzinger) isn't opposed to the idea that us making
 judgements about a colour can be all there is to colour vision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This implies that the colour is out there somehow after all.
 It is there ready to be presented to us, and our detectors that are specificial
ly tailored to detecting them do present them, which then leads to representatio
ns within our brains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This then is where the M-detectors and M-properties come into play -- obviously,
 if entities (or properties) are out there ready to be observed, eventhough
 we might not be able to clearly define them by their physical description
 alone, there must be detectors that reliably find those entities.
 And how these detectors are built at their core is what the multiple drafts
 theory is about.
 It does perfectly explain how it makes sense that qualitative properties
 are out there in the world, ready for us to perceive, and how that perception
 can work without figment or occurent qualities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what Dennett doesn't face is the ineffability of qualia, the distinct
 way they look to us.
 He doesn't aim for appreciation, but merely description.
 More importantly, he also doesn't face the lower-level components of the
 process of perception or attention that are, as Metzinger points out, sometimes
 non-categorizable and not available for concept formation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So his theory of multiple drafts really is an answer to how M-detectors
 can detect M-properties, and how they can make those M-properties globally
 available in a step by step (but processed in parallel, except where one
 process has to wait for the results of another) procedure that finds 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 properties first and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 don't have to correspond to the perceived complexity of the processing
 steps involved, but rather with how optimized the system in question is
 for solving them.
 Things like detecting that the shape in front of us is a face that is looking
 to the right and belongs to your grandmother is a very complex and complicated
 thing, while playing chess is comparably easy.
 Just because something seems easy to us does not make it easy for another
 system -- it's just that our bodies have adapted to needing such face detection
 mechanisms for millions of years, while the ability to play chess only
 has formed in the last couple of thousand years.

Qualia: Still Necessary?

\begin_layout Standard
So with Metzinger, we find that qualia are reducible in principle, once
 we agree that phenomenal presentational content is an ontological possibility
 and most probably what makes us experience qualitative properties in our
 brains.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, they still are a necessary discriminatory step.
 We have a metaphorical quality space in which phenomenal presentational
 content shows up, and we are able to conceptualize volumes within that
 quality space transtemporally.
 These volumes are what qualia depict; they correspond to categories we
 are able to form within that entire quality space.

 They form the categorical borders of our conscious experience, but do not

 they the truly atomic building blocks of experience.
 They are a necessary level of abstraction that holds information not contained
 elsewhere anyway though.

For example, if you think about something you did as a 4 year old kid --
 be it recalled through your own memories, or through reminders from your

 In such a situation, we might not be able to emphatically put ourselves
 into the shoes of that 4 year old kid anymore; the world we lived in back
 then seems nearly as alien to us now as the world of Nagel's bats.
 We have different value systems now, different and way more experiences
 we can relate to, different theories regarding both the world around us
 and ourselves.
 But it is absolutely certain that that 4 year old kid was still you, however

This will be where we incorporate some of Minsky's work into our deliberations:
 He observes that often, we have not just one, but multiple self models.
 Normative ones (what do I want to be like?), descriptive ones (how do I
 usually act in this situation?), of both ourselves and others -- and often,
 the models we have of others are (or at least seem to be) more accurate
 than the models they have of themselves.
 How can that be? Shouldn't I be the final authority when judging what it
 is that makes me myself? Don't I have priviledged access that should enable
 me to form a more accurate, more proper self than others, who merely form
 mental (empathical) models of me?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, there are many deviant forms of subjectivity, and one of
 them is a recurring theme among Metzinger, Dennett, and many other philosophers
 of mind: The multiple personality disorder.
 Of course, because if we want to see what a self is, we best look at a
 place where it is already partially dissected, where its inner workings
 are more prone to lay bare because the protective layer around it has been
 removed and broken -- metaphorically speaking, but often true in a stricter
 sense, as it seems that traumatic childhood experiences are often what
 causes such multiple personality disorders in the first place.

 The somewhat pragmatic (and probably for that very reason intuitively plausible

 matter that is not extended and an extended matter that does not think,
 makes it very easy to point at what it is that creates subjectivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is because the very distinguishing criterion for the

 is that it is able to produce that very subjectivity.
 As such, subjectivity is built into the

\emph default

 Of course, Descartes, being deeply religious, roots this in the soul and

 -- although he explores the concept way less in-depth.
 Here is what Dennett has to say concerning the part of the hard problem
 we're currently looking at:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
A self, according to my theory, is [...] an abstraction defined by the myriads
 of attributions and interpretations (including self-attributions and self-inter
pretations) that have composed the biography of the living body whose Center
 of Narrative Gravity it is.
 As such, it plays a singularly important role in the ongoing cognitive
 economy of that living body, because, of all the tings in the environment
 an active body must make mental models of, none is more crucial than the
 model the agent has of itself.

However, that is all he really says on the subject of what a self actually
 is.
 He explores further why it makes sense to have a self, and how magnificient
 a fiction a self is from a functional (and maybe teleological, although
 he doesn't use that word) point of view.
 He also explores what the moral implications are if a self really is only
 a fiction, concerning responsibility and agency.
 Since this moral tangent is not main subject of this thesis, I would like
 to leave it aside though.

Metzinger: Being No One
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metzinger makes a quite convincing argument, one that goes deeper and further
 than those of other thinkers.
 On the surface, it is quite similar to Dennett's: The self is merely a
 model that we create.
 However, as I said, he does go further than Dennett.
 Let's see how.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The self being merely a model does make sense from an evolutionary point
 of view.
 As Metzinger points out, such a self model can be a tool, and a weapon

 -- awareness of the continuity and existence of a self as opposed to the
 world is the very thing that enables self-directed action in a stricter
 sense, in two ways: It is necessary to have a self-model in order to be
 able to plan and execute directing action at what constitutes the space
 the self is perceived as being in, and it is necessary to have a self-model
 in order to be able to realize that any action is directed at things that
 are part of the own self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A self-model also makes various internal parameters (like hunger, thirst,
 hormone and transmitter levels, intestinal states, and skin temparature)
 available for cognitive processing and thus reflected action.
 This reflected action then is not strictly stimulus-related, but probably
 better denoted as being stimulus-inspired -- in that stimuli may end up
 activating offline phenomenal states that simulate the self-model in certain
 counterfactual situations.
 Only after activating several such possible worlds and comparing them with
 the underlying world zero, we decide on one such possible world and execute
 the actions that we hope will lead to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Self is Not an Illusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I want to get this out of the way first, as it is quite a tempting mistake
 to make: It is wrong to say that the self is an illusion, because if it
 would be, there would need to be somebody or something (a self?) having
 and owning the illusion.
 This would necessarily make the entire argumentation circular -- and that
 exactly is an argument that has been brought up as something that invalidates
 the entire self-model theory.
 Metzinger is aware of this, and he also is aware of the fact that it certainly
 
\emph on
seems
\emph default
 to us as if there were a self.
 In order to explain how that can possibly happen, he expands upon Plato's
 thought experiment of the cave
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
See 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

, pages 547ff.
 I will assume that you are familiar with Plato's thought experiment of
 the cave that he put forth in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Platoa"

\end_inset

, so I will be very brief on its details here.
\end_layout

 where we are pictured as being chained to the ground, unable to turn our
 heads, and merely seeing shadows of the things that actually are, cast
 by a fire in the middle of the cave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many similarities between Plato's cave and Metzinger's self-model
 theory.
 The allegory works for quite some of Metzinger's postulated entities: The
 cave is the entire organism, the shadows are low-dimensional phenomenal
 projections of high-dimensional objects, the fire is neural dynamics, informati
on processing that is constantly perturbed and modulated by sensory and
 cognitive input, and the cave's wall finally is merely another aspect of
 the very same neural process.

 All these things are very similar in that they are entities in both thought
 experiments, directly mappable to one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, there is a fundamental difference between Plato's and Metzinger's
 view, in that Plato believes that it is possible to get up, go out into
 the sun, and then come back and teach people what true forms are.
 He believes that there can be enlightenment, true knowledge.
 Epistemology demystified, experienced ontology possible.
 What a romantic thought.
 Unfortunately, Metzinger does not follow Plato here -- there is no getting
 up in Metzinger's cave, we have to remain chained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And Metzinger doubts that we can get up for one reason: There is nobody
 in the cave -- it is empty, the phenomenal self-model is the entire cave
 and all that is contained within it, but experiences itself as being in
 the center.
 And shadows, phenomenal representations, as real as they may seem, are
 merely interpretations of shaded surfaces.
 The entire cave is nothing but a “continuous online dream about, and internal
 emulation of, itself,”

The PSM, the

phenomenal self-model
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, is the formal name Metzinger gives this part of his theory, and it is
 the more fundamental of the two main building blocks of it.
 The PSM really is the logical conclusion from what we have seen up to this
 point, and in particular, what follows from his multilevel constraints
 and the fact that the system is mistaking the generated transparent self-repres
entation in a naive-realistic self-misunderstanding

 as a proper self.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is his main argument for it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
If all other necessary and sufficient constraints for the emergence of phenomena
l experience are satisfied by a given representational system, the addition
 of a transparent self-model will by necessity lead to the emergence of
 a phenomenal self.
 Phenomenal selfhood results from autoepistemic closure in a self-representing
 system; it is a lack of information.
 The prereflexive, preattentive experience of being someone results directly
 from the contents of the currently active self-model being transparent.
 [...] Under a general principle of ontological parsimony it is not necessary
 (or rational) to assume the existence of selves, because as theoretical
 entities they fulfill no indispensable explanatory function.
 What exists are information-processing systems engaged in the transparent
 process of phenomenal self-modelling.
 All that can be explained by the phenomenological notion of a “self” can
 also be explained using the representationalist notion of a transparent
 self-

 Rather, it is the other way around: The PSM

 a major part of the perspectivalness constraint.There is the prereflexive

 then there is the PSM, and then there is the PMIR that we'll look at in
 chapter

A PSM is formed naturally as soon as the prereflexive proto self-model is
 experienced phenomenally and transparently as an entity in the world by
 a system.
 All the other parts of the self-model, the phenomenal self that is experienced
 as thinker of the system's own thoughts and doer of the system's deeds,
 is merely coating that is by some necessity (through genetic disposition)
 added to that prereflexive self-model during an organism's growth and learning

A phenomenal self-model doesn't necessarily have to form even given many

 He does specify the probable (and intuitively plausible) stance of a critic
 of his model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
There simply is no conceptually necessary connection [...] from the functional
 and representational constraints so far developed to the phenomenal target
 property of selfhood.
 The representational process of mental self-modeling within a coherent
 world-model and a virtual window of presence, holism and dynamics conceded
 as well, does not

necessarily
\emph default
 lead to the existence of a full-blown phenomenal self.
 [...] A system-model simply is not a 
\emph on
self
\emph default

 [...] What is needed -- by conceptual necessity -- to take the step from the
 functional property of centeredness and the representational property of
 self-modeling to the consciously experienced phenomenal property of selfhood?

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Phenomenality-for-Metzinger"

, where we ended up with ineffability as the defining characteristic of
 consciousness.
 It is exactly the phenomenal transparency (that is indeed constituted by
 satisfying the transparency, globality and presentationality constraints)
 of the contents of our mental self-model that is one of the things that
 are necessary for the conscious self-model.
 The other is that the system has to be able to transparently recognize
 (and identify with) the contents of that self-model as itself.
 Metzinger puts this as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
We do not experience the contents of our self-consciousness as the contents
 of a representational process, and we do not experience them as some sort
 of causally active internal placeholder

 and that darkness is constituted in the fact that all vehicle properties
 and many content properties (as inappropriate as this distinction between
 vehicle and content properties may be in this context) just like many causal
 connections between entities in either categories are hidden from introspective
 access.
 A self then is this:

Completely transparent self-representation is characterized by the fact
 that the mechanisms which have led to its activation and the additional
 fact that a concrete internal state exists, which functions as the carrier

 Therefore, the phenomenology of transparent self-modeling is the phenomenology
 of selfhood.

 time, when it isn't needed -- leading to times of partial or entire lack

The brain, the dynamical, self-organizing system as a whole,

 the [self] if and only if it needs the [self] as a representational instrument
 in order to integrate, monitor, predict, and remember its own activities.
 As long as the [self] is needed to navigate the world, the puppet shadow
 dances on the wall of the neurophenomenological caveman's phenomenal state
 space.
 As soon as the system does not need a globally available self-model, it
 simply turns it off.
 Together with the model the conscious experience of selfhood disappears.
 Sleep is the little brother of death.

 It is not possible to be convinced of his theory of phenomenal self-modeling

 integrates first-person and third-person approaches in a new way and that,
 perhaps unfortunately, appears to be strictly impossible and absolutely

Minsky: Multiple Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Minsky approaches the problem of selves (or rather, the perception of one
 self to a person) from a different point of view.
 He doesn't care that much about the genesis of the phenomenality of a self-mode
l (in fact, he borrows much of the philosophical footwork from Dennett),
 but rather looks at the actual causes and implications of self-models,
 and notices that a person usually has a wide array of multi-tier self-models
 at their disposal.
 Those include normative just like positive / descriptive aspects, and have
 a complex internal structure.

First though, we have to look at what it is that makes the brain have multiple
 selves in the first place.

The Six Levels of Mental Activities

\begin_layout Standard
According to Minsky, there are (at least) six levels of mental activities,
 all of which together then constitute consciousness -- and produce the
 self-models.
 Those levels are:

Instinctive Reactions: Things that we are genetically predisposed to do
 -- and that often don't quite fit into the fast-paced modern world.
 There are many instinctive things that still make sense today though; regulatin

 into a bright light source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Learned Reactions: This involves quite some brain power already, because
 we have to know which parts of a situation we want to learn something about
 have to be remembered in what ways, and what the steps that led to eventual
 success then were.
 Nevertheless, many simpler animals (like lab rats) do possess the ability
 to learn new things through positive and negative reinforcement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Deliberative Thinking: At this level, we already have to be able to plan
 ahead.
 We have to be able to imagine things, establish counterfactuals, have some
 way of deciding between alternatives.
 With these things in place, we can decide between multiple possible ways
 we want to achieve a goal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reflective Thinking: This is a continuous monitoring of our own activities,
 that allows glimpses into both the past and the future within short-term
 memory.
 On this level, we are able to think about our own actions, and decide on
 better ways to handle things for a next time.

\begin_layout Enumerate
Learned Reactions require a relatively simple form of a self-model, it is
 enough if there's a self-world distinction that is stringent enough to
 allow remembering which sensory inputs belonged to the self (and, if they
 were initiating motor behaviour, will consequently have to be learned as
 actions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Deliberative Thinking does require a fairly complex phenomenal self-model
 that includes knowledge about what the body and mind bound to the self
 can accomplish, and it also requires the possibility for offline activation
 of that self-model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reflective Thinking does not add to the required complexity of the phenomenal
 self-model, since offline activation was already necessary for the previous
 level.
 It does however pose bigger challenges to the equivalent of Metzinger's
 dynamicity constraint, in that different time streams (the one experienced
 as phenomenal now, and the counterfactual one experienced as phenomenally
 inspected time in reflection) have to be represented at the same time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Self-Reflective Thinking adds to the required complexity of the self-model
 in that more contents of it (namely, mental states, goal representations
 and some emotional states) have to be available for introspection, so they
 have to be part of the opaque component of the self-model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Self-Conscious Reflection finally requires that multiple self-models can
 be inspected at the same time.
 At least the normative goal self-model and the positive descriptive self-model
 have to be available for inspection (that is only introspection for the
 descriptive self-model) and comparison.

 Obviously, that minimization is what science (and in particular, Cartesian

 how consciousness works or what constitutes a self.
 Minsky follows exactly this line of argumentation when he states:

I think [this policy of minimizing complexity] has badly retarded the field
 of psychology.
 For when you

 All of these can come either in normative or positive variants.
 What a switch between multiple such (usually still relatively close to
 each other) subpersonalities changes is what ways to think are available
 (because different brain centers are active and contributing to the functional
 processes generating the current self-model) and thus how we act and think.

Personal Identity

\begin_layout Standard
We certainly do all like the idea of a self, of being an individual.
 This has evolutionary origins, or at least is perfectly compatible with
 our current biological constraints: We are constrained to one single, localized
 body.
 We have a private mind that nobody else can easily see into.
 We claim moral responsibility for deeds we do (and force others to assume
 responsibility for theirs), and construct causal attributions from the
 stance of one self to a body.
 Social relations without selves would be awkward, just like it would be
 way harder to maintain attention and focus if we wouldn't have the illusion
 of a single, continuous stream of consciousness.

If what you are is that organization of information that has structured

 a program can survive the destruction of the computer on which it was created

To continue to where Dennett's analogy leads us, a program cannot run on
 just any computer.
 At least not with extensive further emulatory work: A program that was

 be able to run on another basis (unless they are explicitly made to be

To get back from our reductio ad absurdum of the analogy to consciousness
 and the fiction of selves: A self relies on a huge lot of representative
 and presentative processes that supply it with data.
 Data about both the environment and the inner state that the body the self
 belongs to currently is situated in.
 It also is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

programmed
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in a plethora of parallel processes with corresponding aligning (neural)
 pathways -- pathways that themselves form the processes that data from
 sensory organs must pass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Splitting the self from the body is thus not easily possible, as the body
 at least partially constitutes the self's current contents, and certainly
 formed the self in the past.
 A computer is incredibly different from a brain, so in order to emulate
 a human brain on one of today's computers, there would probably be more
 emulatory work to be done than actual software transfer.

And if the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

software

 because the hardware (neurons and their connections to other neurons) defines
 the software's contents -- there are apparently around 400 specialized

This stays true unless somebody sits down and goes to translate every possible
 low-level call into one that works on the hardware the program should be
 transferred to.
 Of course this is possible, it is today possible to run ancient (by computer
 standards) Commodore 64 programs on an emulator running on current-day
 hardware and operating systems, but the more different those hardware basis
 get, the more emulatory work has to be done.
 So when Dennett says that

 saying that the body's control system is merely the software that runs
 on the brain's computer is inadequate because the brain itself is not only

There are clues that make Metzinger's prereflexive proto self-model intuitively
 plausible.
 For example, phantom limb pains that exist for people who never even had
 limbs in the first place -- there seems to be some hardwired (genetically
 hardcoded and necessarily grown) structures in our brains that correspond
 to certain body parts.

Metzinger has an extensive section concerning phantom limbs in

 In particular, he writes on page 478, referring to physicians and neurologists
 who researched phantom limbs: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

In his discussion Poeck agrees with Sidney Weinstein and Eugene Sersen,
 who in 1961 published a substantial paper containing five case studies
 describing phantom limb experiences in children with 
\emph on
congenital
\emph default
 absence of limbs, that is, phantoms for a limb which had never 
\emph on
existed

, that the assumption of a

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, the functional components that are able to form such a self-model
 are something that warrants more research.
 Because as we have seen, once there is phenomenal experience, and a pre-reflexi
ve proto self-model, the rest that forms our phenomenal self-model (or,
 with Minsky, self-model

 a human-like phenomenal self-model, given the other 10 constraints besides
 perspectivalness and a phenomenally experienced human body? In other words,
 how exactly do we have to define the lower levels of the perspectivalness
 constraint to make it both necessary and sufficient for the generation
 of a phenomenal self-model in a phenomenally experienced process in a human
 brain?

To date, we have made little progress with regard to these questions.
 There are hints and pointers that make the idea of a prereflexive proto
 self-model seem reasonable and able to explain many things that remain
 mysteries in other belief systems.
 We know for example that there are brain regions that invariably are responsibl
e for a certain body part's sensory inputs.
 But there are no fleshed-out theories yet that fit these things together.
 I do believe that this would be a worthy topic for future research.

This chapter goes beyond the minimal notion of a self and offers an analysis
 of how a cognitive first-person perspective can come from a merely phenomenal
 first-person perspective.
 The difference is that beings who only possess a phenomenal first-person
 perspective may be conscious subjects of experience, but not all of them
 also have first-person concepts of themselves (that then enable a cognitive
 first-person perspective).

The object component of the phenomenal first-person perspective is transparent
 and the respective person is, therefore, on the level of phenomenal experience,
 forced into an (epistemically unjustified) existence assumption with respect
 to the intentional content of the object component.
 The same is true of the subject component.
 The second defining characteristic is the transparency of the self-model,
 yielding a phenomenal self depicted as

We now go even further, beyond mere subjectivity, with an outlook at what
 Metzinger's theory implies for sentient beings with a phenomenal self-model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a matter of fact, once we agree that a self is, in the end, a phenomenal
 self-model, systems that have a self necessarily have the prerequisites
 for forming a model of a person.
 After all, they are already modeling themselves with these prerequisites.
 The implication is that these prerequisites could also be used for different
 things than modeling the own personhood -- and that exactly is, according
 to Metzinger, what enables what he calls offline simulations of first-person
 perspectives even for other minds.

These experiences are interesting, because they do not satisfy the transparency

 When thinking about the mental states of fellow human beings in this manner,
 we subjectively experience ourselves as manipulating mental

 On the other hand, all this activity is integrated into the transparent
 background of a phenomenal self, as embodied and as being the initiator
 of these cognitive activities.

This then leads to the possibility of modeling the phenomenal 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

you,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 modeling the experience of being confronted with another agent, another
 person.
 This task really is not only one of simulation, but also one of emulation.
 We are able to read the minds of other humans, to some extent, by constructing
 complex models of their selves that include goal structures and predicted
 motor behaviour.
 It has been shown that some of the very neural structures that an observed
 human activates for, for example, moving a finger, are also being activated
 in observers' brains.
 Metzinger explains this as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
The motor representation embedded in this partition [...] underlies the conscious
 experience of 
\emph on
being a self in the act of imitating
\emph default
.
 The motor representation not embedded in the PSM is neither opaque nor
 transparent.
 It is a functional property, possibly not even directly reflected on the
 level of phenomenal experience.
 It is a part of the unconscious self-model which, however, is currently
 used as a model of a certain part of external reality, of the social environmen
t, namely, as an 
\emph on
other
\emph default
 self-model.

So, having a phenomenal self-model like we do is a very efficient way of
 enabling intersubjectivity by means of enabling empathy.
 Only if we can realize that other persons are agents can we act according
 to that fact, and only if we can model some of their goals and mental states
 (or at least goals and mental states that we would have if we were them)
 can we take those into account and act according to them.

Do note that the PMS alone does not suffice to generate such relations:
 The relation itself is modeled as a form of intentional direction, so it
 does also require some form of intentionality.

I do agree with most parts of Dennett's view.
 I agree with almost all parts of Metzinger's view, and I even also agree
 with almost all parts of Minsky's view.
 Considering they contradict each other only in minor points, this can only
 mean one thing: I propose that we blend them together and form a theory
 that incorporates them all.
 Allow me to attempt a crude version of just that.

Since Dennett's ideas on subjectivity are not as fleshed-out as these of
 Metzinger, and can mostly be expressed by a subset of Metzinger's ideas,
 I think we can for now drop Dennett.
 This leaves Metzinger's generation of phenomenal self-models, but with
 the reservation that not one such self-model is generated during the lifetime
 of a system.
 Rather, from one moment to the next, different critics and experts
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As I mentioned before, unfortunately we do not have the space to look at
 Minsky's critics and experts -- essentially, they are brain centers responsible
 for activating different other brain centers that then process sensory
 data and other mental contents in different ways.
 This then results in different Ways to Think being available to the system.
\end_layout

 are active, thus different parts of the brain provide functional processing
 abilities (leading to at least some lower-level parts of the phenomenal
 self-model supervening on different neural correlates from one moment to
 the next), and thus a different phenomenal self-model can be experienced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we are modeling normative selves, this happens in an opaque manner,
 so those are available for introspection -- but the fact that our positive
 phenomenal self-model changes from one moment to the next is not necessarily
 available to us, since it is transparent (and some parts of it are ineffable).
 We can, as with other things, introspectively distance ourselves from our
 deeds and look at what we are doing; an example of that is when we take
 a step back and realize we are just acting so rudely because we are jealous
 when we really shouldn't be -- but by default, we don't do that, and often
 don't realize how we're really not the same today as we were yesterday.

 What I intend to look at here is the peculiar way in which our mind can

 as meaning a thing), or immanent objectivity.
 Every mental hpenomenon includes something as an object within itself,
 although they do not all do so in the same way.
 In presentation something is presented, in judgement something is affirmed

Suppose some human being, Jones, looks out the window and thereupon goes
 into the state of thinking he sees a horse.
 [...] Suppose the planet Twin Earth were just like Earth, save for having
 schmorses where we have horses.
 (Schmorses [...] are well-nigh indistinguishable from horses by all but trained
 biologists with special apparatus, but they aren't horses [...].) If we whisk
 Jones off to Twin Earth, land of the schmorses, and confront him in the
 relevant way with a schmorse, then either he really is, still, provoked
 into the state of believing he sees a horse (a mistaken, nonveridical belief)
 or he is provoked by that schmorse into believing, for the first time (and
 veridically), that he is seeing a schmorse.
 [...] However hard it may be to determine exactly which state he is in, he
 is really in one or the other [...].
 Anyone who finds this intuition irresistible believes in original intentionalit

 Anyone who finds this intuition dubious if not downright dismissible can

So, essentially, evolutionary fitness and rationality are sole criterions

\begin_layout Standard
Strictly speaking, this definition also means that only biological systems
 (no artificial or postbiotic systems whatsoever) can possess any form of
 intentionality, as they strictly need to satisfy biological needs.
 However, and I believe we would not run counter to Dennett's intentions
 with this project, I think we can safely substitute a similar concept for
 those

 It would have to contain both extrinsic and intrinsic requirements for
 survival, both short- and long-term.

 this also includes reproduction.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

There must indeed be a higher level of description at which we can attribute
 external-semantical properties to relatively global features of the network's
 activities, but at such a level the interations and relationships between
 semantic elements are not computational but [...] statistical, emergent, holistic.
 [...] In Connectionist models, the (typically simulated) hardware does add
 something: just which content-relative effects actually occur (something
 that is only statistically describable at the high-level) depends on low-level
 features of the history of operations.
 The different flavors of cognition emerge from the activity, without being
 specifically designed to emerge.

As we've seen, Dennett does not believe that there is such a thing as original
 or intrinsic intentionality.
 Akin to Searle not finding anything that could give his Chinese Room's
 homunculus any intrinsic intentionality that he could pass on to the system
 he is in, Dennett does not find any part of the human mind that could give
 it intrinsic intentionality.
 He does refer to Dawkins

 when he describes what us humans really are, from an evolutionary point
 of view.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
He suggests a thought experiment where we would want to experience the year
 2401, and then build a robot that could contain and protect our hibernating
 body for the time until then.
 Since the world is an inherently dynamic place and merely sitting always
 in the same spot could probably not ensure our survival, that robot would
 have to be able to distinguish things that are good or bad for its continued
 functionality, would require some forms of autonomous self-control with
 goals and subgoals, would have need for quick-and-dirty approximations
 in its calculative appraoches to problem solving.
 It would show equivalents of our mental states of wondering, seeing, deciding,
 and essentially exhibit a sophisticated form of derived intentionality,
 similar to what a machine passing the Turing Test would need to show.
 Now, what Dennett points out is this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
If we cling to this view [that this artifact would only possess derived
 intentionality], the conclusion forced upon us is that our own intentionality
 is exactly like that of the robot, for the science-fiction tale I have
 told is not new; it is just a variation on Dawkins' vision of us (and all
 other biological species) as “survival machines” designed to prolong the
 futures of our selfish genes.
 We are artifacts, in effect, designed over the eons as survival machines
 for genes that cannot act swiftly and informedly in their own interests.
 [...] So our intentionality is derived from the intentionality of our “selfish”
 genes!

Metzinger: Just a Phenomenal Model (PMIR)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PMIR stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phenomenal model of the intentionality relation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and it is the higher-level of the two main building blocks of Metzinger's
 theory of consciousness.
 It is also part of the perspectivalness constraint, just like the prereflexive
 proto-self and the PSM are.
 Metzinger sees that perspectivalness constraint as one of the three main
 building blocks of subjective consciousness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
The concept of a PMIR will, finally, give us a more precise understanding
 of 
\emph on
constraint 6
\emph default
, the perspectivalness constraint for conscious processing [...].
 Together with the idea of a transparent global model of the world, as activated
 within a window of presence, this third major theoretical entity will [...]
 allow us to offer a more informative version of the minimal concept of
 
\emph on
subjective
\emph default
 consciousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly to the PSM (see chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Being-No-One"

\end_inset

), the PMIR is merely a phenomenal model, merely an emergent, transparent
 phenomenal structure.
 It is a conscious mental model, presented phenomenally in a transparent
 manner and thus experienced as unquestionably real.
 Its content is an ongoing, episodic subject-object relation -- representing
 the system as subject through its PSM, and the object in an asymmetrical
 relation to that subject.

 of relations, relations that would be called “attitude specificator” in
 propositional attitude psychology.
 Those include attending, thinking, willing, fearing, and many others.
 They also have a direction -- the “arrow of attention” points outward (in
 regular perception) or inward (in introspection), from the first-person
 perspective, but always originates from the subject component -- putting
 subject and object into the aforementioned asymmetrical relationship.

Phenomenalizing Intentionality

\begin_layout Standard
If we want to naturalize intentionality (as Metzinger wants to), phenomenalizing
 it is the necessary first step.
 Here's how he explains this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Phenomenalizing intentionality, I would submit, may be a necessary detour,
 an indispensable first step in the project of 
\emph on
naturalizing
\emph default
 intentionality 
\emph on
tout court
\emph default
.
 Meaning and the conscious experience of meaningfulness have to be separated.
 Generally speaking, mental representations possess two kinds of content:
 phenomenal content and intentional content.
 Phenomenal content supervenes locally.
 Intentional content, in many cases, is determined by external and nonlocal
 factors.
 [...] It is important to note how intentionality [...] is 
\emph on
itself
\emph default
 depicted on the level of phenomenal content.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of this is obvious: Meaning and the conscious experience of meaningfulness
 (which corresponds to intentionality) are not the same things, although
 they are experienced (thus the phenomenality) as being intuitively and
 unquestionably the same.
 Metzinger now makes the argument that while we do know that phenomenal
 content supervenes locally, we do not necessarily know that intentional
 content, which refers to external entities, also supervenes locally.
 If we can show that intentional content is just a special form of phenomenal
 content, it goes without saying that intentional content supervenes locally
 and can thus potentially be naturalized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Showing that intentional content is a special form of phenomenal content
 is of course what the theory about the PMIR is all about.
 Since all there is to intentionality is the phenomenal experience of an
 intentionality relation, it could exist completely without ontological
 counterparts to the entities represented by said intentionality relation's
 phenomenal contents.
 Intentionality could be entirely virtual, and we couldn't possibly notice.
 In fact, it is even probable that we misrepresent many things out there
 in the world, because that misrepresentation has proved to be more beneficial
 for our continued survival as a species:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
This global effect [of “global immersion”] is achieved by continuously activatin
g dynamic and transparent representations of a subject-object relation,
 which episodically integrates the self-model and those perceptual, cognitive
 or volitional objects, which cause the changes in its content, by telling
 an internal story about how these changes came about.
 This story does not have to be a true story.
 It may well be a greatly simplified confabulation, which has proved to
 be functionally adequate.

This is mainly because phenomenal volition is a form of phenomenal intentionalit

 And without volition, even goal-driven movement cannot be experienced as

The central point is that many such arm movements clearly seem to be goal-direct

Consolidation

\begin_layout Standard
It is rare that a philosopher is talking about intentionality without also
 talking about consciousness or subjective experience in general.
 The two concepts are very close to each other -- or rather, they are interwoven.
 Brentano already pointed this out when he revived the concept of intentional
 inexistence.
 Intentionality is the prime precondition for consciousness, because all
 conscious mental processes are also directed at something (directed at
 an intentional object) and originate from an intentional subject.
 Metzinger puts this as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
We can now see how a full-blown subjective consciousness evolves through
 three major levels: The generation of a world-model, the generation of
 a self-model, and the transient integration of certain aspects of the world-mod
el 
\emph on
with
\emph default
 the self-model.
 What follows is a minimal working concept of subjective experience: Phenomenall
y subjective experience consists in transparently modeling the intentionality
 relation within a global, coherent model of the world embedded in a virtual
 window of presence.

 for consciousness -- even misnomers, using

With intentionality sitting at the core of consciousness, so much that it
 is often used as the defining characteristic of consciousness or more,
 it is very important that we have a clear picture of what it actually is.
 Metzinger, and to a lesser extent Dennett, has shown us a way to naturalize
 intentionality without losing the information an intrinsic intentionality
 could provide, while at the same time allowing us better insight into how
 it is produced and what its effects on the physical brain are.
 I do believe that this is a worthy approach to take.

Dennett's Intentionality Should Be Phenomenal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I am talking about Dennett's argumentation that intentionality is nothing
 but an ascription that happens through a stance that we take on when looking
 at entities that might exhibit inentionality.
 We remember, he says that it all comes down to whatever intentional states
 we ascribe to a target system has to be what its intentionality truly is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This argumentation seems to be counter-intuitive to me (among many others),
 and the reason why that is appears to be two-fold:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Less importantly, it can lead to a circular argumentation culminating in
 an infinite regress.
 If something (me, for example) ascribes intentionality to something, it
 has to do so intentionally.
 There must be an intentionality ascribing the intentionality, because ascriptio
n is an intentional act.
 I guess this could be explained away by merely a different choice of words
 of course, nevertheless, I think it is important.

More importantly, his argumentation is strictly counter-intuitive because
 intentional acts for us humans have what Nagel might call a what-is-it-like-nes
s to them.
 They are phenomenal in nature.
 This is implicitly included in the mere notion of intentionality -- intentional
 acts ring a bell, because we all know what it is like to conduct an intentional
 act, and we also know that for a computer merely following a script, following
 that script can't possibly be anything like us conducting such an intentional
 act.
 In fact, arguably, for today's computers it's not anything like anything
 at all.

 know from chapter

 I would argue however that for an observer-relative ascription of intentionalit
y to be intuitively intentional, it has to be conducted by a system that
 has phenomenal states.
 It has to be a specimen of phenomenal intentionality, and it has to satisfy
 at least Metzinger's perspectivalness and transparency constraints.

 We can uncover the corresponding family of reactive dispositions in the

 more and more about the no doubt highly idiosyncratic relations a vulture
 can form to a set of olfactory stimuli.
 But we already know a lot that we won't learn.
 We will never find a vulture being provoked by those stimuli to wonder,
 as a human being might, whether the chicken is not just slightly off tonight.
 And we won't find any amusement or elaborate patterns of association or
 Proustian reminiscence.
 Am I out in front of the investigations here? A little bit, but note what
 kind of investigations they are.
 It turns out that we end up where we began: analyzing patterns of behavior
 (external and internal -- but not “private”), and attempting to interpret
 them in the light of evolutionary hypotheses regarding their past or current
 functions.

Personally, I find it puzzling that Dennett should say that consciousness
 is a gradual phenomenon and then assume that vultures have no dispositional
 stances in their intentional relations that are similar to our amusement
 or wondering.
 But that is beside the point.
 And of course, even if they are similar, they won't be exactly the same
 for certain, so I do agree that they will not have the 
\emph on
exact
\emph default
 same dispositions as us humans do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But, remember what I said about the difference between appreciation and
 description (see chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "Difference-Appreciation-Description"

\end_inset

).
 I believe this difference is both important and apparently ignored by Dennett.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even assuming that description is all we can aim for (with which I disagree):
 The whole of Dennett's argumentation does build on on the assumption that
 there are no strictly private such experienced patterns.
 And Metzinger clearly does show that not only there are such private patterns,

 but also why they are private: Because they're causally active (and thus
 can't just be ignored

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Of course, there could be an even more fine-grained descriptory level that
 would also capture those, but this is where appreciation stops working
 -- as soon as we merely have a description, we can't relive the experience,
 and thus it can't be fully appreciated anymore.
 The ineffable parts could of course be described as well in principle --
 finding and properly describing them would be incredibly hard, but not
 impossible.
 However, not even heterophenomenology would be sufficient there, as this
 phenomenal presentational content may be available for introspection, but
 is not symbolic -- we would need both a full functional description of
 the human brain and a complete neurological map of it in order to even
 have a chance at uncovering that description.

\begin_layout Part
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We started out with some definitions and clarifications, putting epistemology,
 dualism, supervenience and evolution into a naturalist context, and having
 a look at some other conceptual subjects that frame this thesis' subjects.
 We then looked at all the individual fundamental parts that make phenomenal
 subjective consciousness what it is -- phenomenology, qualia, subjectivity
 and intentionality -- and have looked at various ways in which philosophers
 to this day have explained them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What is still missing is that we put all these things together, into a bigger
 picture, and that we look out into what new achievements this can lead
 us to in the nearer future.
 This is what this part of my thesis is about.

Summary and the Bigger Picture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us take a step back from the four partial problems that I identified
 and analyzed in part 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "The-Four-Questions"

\end_inset

.
 With all the bits and pieces in place, we now know that full phenomenality
 partially relies on subjectivity, while subjectivity itself relies on some
 of the multilevel constraints that make up the rest of phenomenality as
 well.
 We have realized that intentionality relies on some basic form of self-model,
 while at the same time it is also what enables the higher levels of the
 self-model.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Don't worry if this isn't familiar to you, I didn not make this explicit
 so far.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We also know that the most basic form of mental content are not qualia,
 but phenomenal representational content -- and that qualia do have an ontologic
al justification as well after all, because they group regions of presentational
 quality space for the symbolic 
\emph on
re
\emph default
presentation that intentionality enables.
 With these additional bits of knowledge in place, we will need to structure
 our summary with some differences (with slightly more complexity) from
 the analysis itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will now present again all the entities that I think are important for
 making up phenomenal subjective intentional experience.
 I will again follow the natural order of apparent increasing complexity,
 but with more confidence than I did so in part 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "The-Four-Questions"

\end_inset

.
 After all, we did have a thorough look at the pieces of the puzzle by now.
 This does mean however that I now have a different idea as to what is more
 complex than what else, and it also means that since so many things are
 interwoven, untangling them means that we require quite some intermediate
 steps between those four (too) easy levels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Proto Self-Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a requirement for the PSM and the PMIR that is actually part of
 Metzinger's perspectivalness constraint
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
See chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Perspectivalness"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 as well.
 I am of course speaking of the still somewhat miraculous proto self-model
 that we saw in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Prereflexive-Proto-Self"

\end_inset

.
 While I do believe that further research into what exactly constitutes
 this proto self-model is warranted, there must be at least the following
 two factors that importantly help in building it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Functional presentation centers in the brain that are responsible for receiving
 nerve cell input from various body parts (including inner organs).
 These are obviously genetically hardcoded, as the phantom limb experiments
 we spoke of in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Prereflexive-Proto-Self"

\end_inset

 show.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A single localizable body as region of maximal stability and invariance
 (that we already encountered in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Perspectivalness"

\end_inset

) that allows the system to get accustomed to taking a first-person point
 of view stance and also assigning entities and properties to the first
 person this stance originates from.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arguably, this prereflexive proto-self is not even only a prerequisite for
 the PSM and the PMIR, but also a prerequisite for phenomenal experience
 itself: Without such a first-person point of view, the possibility of localizin
g sensory inputs is not given, and thus there is no way any higher concepts
 that refer to locations in any way can possibly form.
 A consciousness that has no such proto self-model may well have coherent
 (albeit very abstract) thoughts, but only the multimodality in which we
 can experience the world around us allows us to form a world model at all.
\end_layout

Basic Phenomenality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The level of consciousness out of those we saw in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Levels-of-Consciousness"

\end_inset

 that is required for a very basic form of phenomenality
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At least if we eventually want to reach consciousness -- of course, we could
 insert an intermediate step with Metzinger's Minimal Consciousness here
 as well.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is probably the one Metzinger calls “Differentiated Consciousness.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This includes the presentationality constraint (2, the phenomenal Now),
 the globality constraint (3, integration into a coherent global state),
 their expansions in the convolved holism constraint (4, subdivisions within
 subdivisions that split this global state apart) and the dynamicity constraint
 (5, that allows a system to experience past and future, and the Now embedded
 in them).
 Also, we definitely need the transparency constraint (7, epistemic closure
 concerning inner workings of mental processes), because the world zero
 has to be ineffably experienced, in a naive-realistic misunderstanding
 as unquestionably real, or it is not phenomenal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since we realized in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Levels-of-Consciousness"

\end_inset

 that the ultrasmoothness constraint (10, homogeneity of simple content
 and the non-existence of a grain problem) really is a prerequisite for
 convolved holism (as we get into an infinite regress otherwise when attempting
 to subdivide former wholes infinitely -- which is exactly what the grain
 problem is about), it will have to be included in this step as well, although
 it will only be required for its true strength, concept formation, when
 we introduce qualia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we found in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Levels-of-Consciousness"

\end_inset

 as well, we probably need the global availability constraint (1, mental
 contents are available for deliberately guided attention, cognitive reference
 and control of action) as well, with Minsky's reservations that we saw
 in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Minsky-Global-Availability-Restrictions"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the adaptivity constraint (11, everything has to make sense from an
 evolutionary perspective), at least in its weakened form from chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Weaker-Adaptivity"

\end_inset

, is certainly necessary for a conscious system that is also perceivable
 as such by us, it is not necessary for basic phenomenality.
 However, since my goal is to have a full analysis of a conscious system
 in this summary, I would like to include it in this part of the description
 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point we have a system that has sensory organs that can potentially
 reach out into the world and into the system itself as well, with all the
 limitations that the transparency constraint sets.
 It is ready for input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Phenomenal Presentational Content
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we saw in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Phenomenal-Presentational-Content"

\end_inset

, qualia are not the atomic entities that they were made out to be.
 Phenomenal presentational content is the most basic form of experience,
 because there are kinds of nonconceptual experience that are so subtle
 and fine-grained that they cannot be categorized.
 These special sub-qualia entities are not accessible for concept formation
 or transtemporal reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notably, while the step of presenting phenomenal content to a system is
 somewhat trivial from a philosophical perspective, it is about the most
 computationally complicated, and the one most of today's attempts at producing
 weak artificial intelligence are struggling with.
 It includes mostly pattern matching tasks: Speech recognition, facial recogniti
on, three-dimensional object perception, orientation, memory formation,
 and other things that I will talk about in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "The-Less-Hard-Problems"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The framework and procedural possibility for these things has to be, in
 the case of biological systems, genetically hardcoded and built into the
 proto self-model, as it is not possible to build these from scratch, not
 even for such an efficiently self-learning system as our body and brain.
 But in order to be able to perceive the data from these perceptive and
 categorizing processes as presentational content, we also require basic
 phenomenality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arguably, the representation of intensities contraint (9, analogue representatio
n of sensory contents) is necessary for phenomenal presentational content
 at least in biological systems, as probably all the important biological
 sensors are analogue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Basic Subjectivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the spirit of merging the concepts of Minsky and Metzinger (as I attempted
 to do in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Multiple-Phenomenal-Self-Models"

\end_inset

), subjectivity here really is all about multiple phenomenal self-models
 that the phenomenal system forms, out of phenomenal presentational content
 that is invariant and thus perceived as internal (which essentially is
 the way the proto self-model is transparently presented to the system),
 plus social influences and conventions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Those self-models consist of the six levels of Minsky, as seen in chapter
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Minsky-Multiple-Models"

\end_inset

 (that somewhat correspond to Freud's distinction between Id, Ego and Super-Ego).
 However, for the later of them we require an intentionality relation, so
 only two such levels (the ones correllating to the Freudian Id) are part
 of the basic subjectivity we are about to describe.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Instinctive Reactions - requiring no self-model yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Learned Reactions - forming a simple self-model that has the bipartition
 between self and world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These levels are necessarily entirely transparent, because as soon as we
 want to add opacity, we need a way to relate to the opaque parts -- which
 is only possible if we can model intentionality.
 Basic subjectivity however is more than the proto self-model in that it
 incorporates sensory input and allows processing it in various ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Intentionality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to progress any further from basic subjectivity, it is necessary
 to consciously model the relation of the system depicted by such basic
 subjectivity to both the world model and its own self-model.
 Otherwise, we have to remain at a level that is barely conscious at all
 -- a purely reactive system in many ways, and certainly not one to which
 we could make reasonably meaningful ascriptions of intentionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going with Dennett in dismissing intrinsic intentionality as per the argumentati
on we looked at in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "No-Intrinsic-Intentionality"

\end_inset

, we have but one choice: There is no such intrinsic intentionality, so
 we need a replacement.
 And, handily, we have one in Metzinger's phenomenal model of the intentionality
 relation that we encountered in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "PMIR"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That model is an entity that is continuously rebuilt in a dynamical process,
 hardwired in the brain, that allows us to 
\emph on
re
\emph default
present entities that formerly were only presentata.
 It is phenomenal in that we experience it as being meaningful, and it depicts
 the relation from the transparently represented subject component to an
 object component that is part of a huge selection of entities that would
 qualify for filling the “object component” slot in a system's intentional
 modeling framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That relation is then presented as being a certain kind of such relation
 -- having an attitude specificator (for propositional attitude psychology)
 or intentional content (for Husserlian phenomenality).
 These kinds of relations in turn are presented as equivalence classes that
 the system can represent and consequently analyze by making them object
 components of such a phenomenal model of an intentionality relation of
 their own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that the PMIR has to be able to accomodate large classes of both
 object components and attitude specificators.
 It has to be able to present all of these object components as the same
 kind of object component -- the kind of “the entity that I currently relate
 to.” And it has to present all of these attitude specificators as “the way
 in which I relate to that entity.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Qualia
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While qualia are the true test for ultrasmoothness because it is now required
 for us forming proper categories of content, we did introduce the ultrasmoothne
ss constraint (10) for basic phenomenality already and can thus merely apply
 it to phenomenal presentational content now.
 As we saw in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Qualia-Still-Necessary"

\end_inset

, eventhough traditional qualia as truly atomic cannot stand when faced
 with phenomenal presentational content that in fact 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 subdivide it (meaning that qualia cannot possibly be atomic and undivisible),
 qualia still do have legitimation as the concept of volumes of qualitative
 space, borders of concept formative capabilities of a system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a matter of fact, for qualia we do need to be able to form concepts,
 and for that we require ways to relate to phenomenal presentational content.
 So we need both basic subjectivity (or we don't know what it is that relates
 to the presentational content) and intentionality (or we can't relate to
 it at all).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Full Subjectivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is more to full subjectivity than to basic subjectivity, because as
 soon as we also have an intentionality relation, we can potentially relate
 to our basic self-model (that in turn presents the proto self-model).
 I will list the first two levels again here as well, although only levels
 3-6 are really what this chapter is about:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Instinctive Reactions - requiring no self-model yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Learned Reactions - forming a simple self-model that has the bipartition
 between self and world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Deliberative Thinking - adding phenomenality and offline activation to the
 requirements for the self-model, and adding the requirement for a model
 of the intentionality relation to the system as a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reflective Thinking - not really adding complexity, but requiring the dynamicity
 constraint's processes
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Or rather, the processes currently executing those process descriptions
 that enable the system to satisfy the dynamicity constraint.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to be able to be activated independently by different streams of thought.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A stream of thought really is just such a process in the brain, initiated
 originally by some form of sensory input (that is experienced as presentational
 content and conceptualized as qualia).
 This sensory input can well be of system-internal origin -- after all,
 our bodies never are truly immobile, at least the heart is beating all
 the time.
 And self-initiated motor action can well lead to further sensory inputs.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Self-Reflective Thinking - requiring parts of the self-model to be opaque,
 or at least the possibility to make them opaque.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Self-Conscious Reflection - requiring that multiple self-models have to
 be available in parallel and can be compared.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These six levels together form a particular self-model.
 One or several of these self-models is always active when there is conscious
 experience (there has to be at least one active, or there is no experiencing
 self -- remember chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Switching-off-the-Self"

\end_inset

 -- and only one of them at a time is fully transparent in standard cases

There certainly are several such self-models at once transparently active

), but as we saw in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Multiple-Self-Models"

\end_inset

 there is no complete all-encompassing entire-self-model because that would
 lead to too much computational complexity for our brain.
 Rather, only select memories and behaviours are available to each individual
 self, both for practical (simplification through information hiding) and
 continuity reasons; it makes sense to be able to rely on yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such self-models are then created for descriptive context-dependant positive
 analysis tasks, but also for normative goal-relative tasks.
 The normative tasks can be ethical, moral, or serving other goals

These self-modeling routines are then also borrowed for intersubjectivity
 and empathy, the subject of chapter

 As such, such a self-model is also the requirement for meaningful (in the
 same experiential sense) language generation, because only if you can model
 somebody as a person is it interesting to truly tell them something.

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at parallels to Metzinger's levels of consciousness in chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

: By this point we have added all of his constraints including the perspectivaln
ess constraint (6, including the proto self-model, the PMS and the PMIR),
 the full transparency constraint (7, epistemic closure concerning inner
 workings of mental processes with the possibility of making some of these
 processes opaque) and the offline activation constraint (8, allowing representa
tional content that is not directly driven by presentational content).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So together with the constraints we already added for basic phenomenality,
 we now have a fully conscious system that has, to say it with Searle, “causal
 powers equivalent to those of the brain.”

Artificial Intelligence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I set out to write this diploma thesis, I planned sections about artificial
 intelligence -- where we stand, what positions and approaches there are,
 and how we can attempt to incorporate the findings from philosophy of mind
 into research from computer science.
 Unfortunately, I had to cut these parts eventually -- there just wasn't
 enough place to talk about all of that as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, I do believe that artificial intelligence is one of the scientific
 fields of research that can help philosophy of mind, and vice versa.
 Computer science is where a philosopher of mind can experiment and put
 his theories to the test.
 And conversely, philosophy of mind is where a computer scientist can draw
 inspiration for experiments in artificial intelligence from.

 But in the discussion following the article, he does put forth a very important
 and necessary distinction: The one between weak and strong artificial intellige
nce.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Weak artificial intelligence is a mere simulation of intelligent behaviour.
 It might fool us, it might even pass the Turing Test,

 or it might be different altogether from the way us humans act and think
 and reliably solve problems us humans can't solve.
 Weak artificial intelligence basically is any kind of systematic behaviour
 that seems as if it was intelligent to us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, all (or at least, most) of today's efforts that go towards
 producing artificial intelligence are purely behaviourist.
 We try to replicate human-like behaviour, and think that the machines that
 we produce will then automatically become intelligent and (more importantly)
 conscious.
 I think that this thesis shows up at least some hints as to why this approach
 will not necessarily lead to truly conscious systems.

\begin_layout Standard
Strong artificial intelligence on the other hand is true intelligence that
 includes subjectivity, phenomenality and intentionality, one that can feel
 qualia.
 Essentially, it is artificial intelligence after we've solved the hard
 problem of consciousness, and successfully applied the solution to an artificia
l system.

The Need for a New Approach

Minsky is a proponent of an older tradition of artificial intelligence,
 a more formal one that puts less focus on self-learning systems.
 Let's hear what he has to say about genetic algorithms and neural networks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
I'd like to argue that if you're interested in artificial intelligence these
 days you're exposed to a lot of arguments that ...
 well, in the early days, people tried to do things with symbolic AI, sometimes
 contemptuously called old-fashioned AI, and that was too rigid and rule-based
 and mechanical, and it had to be programmed.
 What happened starting around 1980 was that most AI researchers tried to
 move in the direction of making machines smart without programming them,
 by using neural networks or genetic algorithms or statistical models.
 The value of that is that you're hoping that your machine can learn to
 be smart without your knowing how it does it.

While neither him nor me want to diminish the value of the many achievements
 of artificial intelligence research in recent years, he does have a point:
 We cannot expect from our machines to learn to be smart without us knowing
 how not only it'll do that, but also how it could even learn that.

How This Thesis Fits In
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I do believe that this thesis here does help in going towards a new approach.
 Arguably, we need a framework, a base that allows all the other important
 parts of current research in artificial intelligence to work together,
 to form a bigger whole.
 They are the Ways to Think of a porential future postbiotic or artificial
 consciousness.
 They are what enables it.
 But in addition to these Ways to Think, we need something they are embedded
 in.
 A thing producing phenomenality, a transparent representation system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To say it with Minsky, when he talks about how all of the currently employed
 strategies and methods of producing (weak) artificial intelligence have
 this weakness:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
In fact, all of these methods are very useful for certain problems.
 What we don't know in general is: For what kind of problem is it good to
 use a statistical inference system? What kinds of problems are ones that
 can be learned and handled by neural networks or by genetic algorithms?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
What I'm proposing along with Gerry Sussman and Hal Abelson is to develop
 a new kind of AI system that has places in which we can insert all of the
 useful results that tens of thousands of AI researchers have made.

What conclusions we reached from the theories of Dennett, Metzinger and

 Because as Dennett says:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Making mistakes is the key to making progress.
 [...] Instead of turning away in denial when you make a mistake, you should
 become a connoisseur of your own mistakes, turning them over in your mind
 as if they were works of art, which in a way they are.
 You should seek out opportunities to make grand mistakes, just so you can
 then recover from them.

The Less Hard, But Still Hard Problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I attempted to look at what it is that enables phenomenality and subjectiv
ity in conscious systems, there are plenty of other things that are required
 for a truly conscious system like us humans are.
 Most of these subjects are already topic of extensive research.
 Many of them are in the prime focus of today's attempts to produce artificial
 intelligence, while others are subject of psychological, neurophysiological,
 or even didactical fields of science.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will only briefly touch all these subjects, while giving some pointers
 as to what research I found that helps enlighten our understanding of them,
 but keep in mind that there is much more that could be said about any of
 them.
 I would even go so far as to say that we do not fully understand any of
 them -- we're not able to, exactly because they all are so interwoven with
 the hard problem of consciousness itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Presentational Content Generation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is, as a matter of fact, one of the prime topics of today's research
 into (deliberately weak) artificial intelligence.
 Pattern recognition tasks are necessary for conceptualization of sensory
 input (in the case of artificial intelligence, often through cameras, scanners
 or in the form of text or other prepared data) -- and exactly these pattern
 recognition tasks are what the modeled (trivial versions of) neurons in
 neural networks are particularly good at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, today's artificial algorithms are nowhere near as good as
 the ones evolution gave us humans.
 As it turns out, and as was not expected at first, it really is the case
 that those things that appear to be easiest to us humans seem to be really
 hard for a computer, while obviously complex things like playing chess
 are comparably trivial.
\begin_inset Foot

 chess -- a traditional computer program does it through raw computational
 power and predefined libraries.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These pattern matching tasks are so close to what we will need for forming
 presentational content for one reason: Our brain only works with concepts,
 not with sensory data itself.
 And in order to be able to work with these concepts, they have to be formed
 -- they have to be grouped and categorized.
 This grouping and categorization 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 a kind of pattern matching, and it is exactly what optical character recognitio
n (OCR) or similar tasks where pattern matching is employed are about.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Integration of Memory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The kind of memory that a mind like ours requires is pretty complex.
 It consists of way more than just the raw, abstract and atomic pieces of
 data we currently use for storing data in computers.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
That isn't to say that it would be impossible in principle to store such
 semantic data on current-day computer hard drives, but there would need
 to be an abstraction layer between this semantic and a trivial raw representati
on of said data.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The resourcefulness capabilities of a human brain are vast and diverse
 -- we do not directly access our knowledge, but often reason by analogies,
 and certainly associate by such analogies.
 Minsky calls the structures we use for this kind of reasoning “panalogies,”

 for “parallel analogies.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Analogies because every entity in our memory, every bit of knowledge is
 linked to multiple other bits -- to similar objects, to properties, to
 a time and place if it is an episodic memory, to solutions if the entity
 is a known problem, and generally to other related entities and concepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Parallel because every bit of knowledge is embedded in different realms
 (physical, dominion, mental, and more) with such analogies.
\end_layout

 of “common sense” knowledge,

 Learning essentially simplifies decision-making by storing context-relative

 that encompasses all of the processes up to recall -- encoding and storage
 are obvious, but consolidation is definitely an important part of it as
 well; it is embedding atomic facts in the panalogies that make them available
 for context-relative retrieval later on.

This means that I do not believe that there is such a thing as properly
 non-associative learning.
 Semantic memory may not be stored associated to the context it was learned
 in, but it certainly is associated with the contexts it is potentially
 useful in.
 Otherwise, I do not see how it could possibly be retreived later on.
 As such, there is probably a gradual and not a binary difference between
 episodic and semantic memory -- a memory is episodic to the extent that
 it is associated (semantically, or at least experienced as such) with the
 circumstances it was obtained in.

 We need less time to reorient (in the sense of having to form new counterfactua
l self-models, often with motor simulations, that we then need to compare
 with the goal state) and thus can spend more time on executing behaviour
 that is efficient in regards to reaching a goal state.
 This can go so far that we are able to execute that behaviour while being
 consciously engaged with an entirely different subject.
 The behaviour itself is also more efficient, because learning allows us
 to anticipate common problems and avoid errors we made in earlier attempts
 of executing the action we improved through the learning process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This makes it clear why teaching an action is often difficult for people
 who learned to do that action really well: They no longer need to think
 about the (motor or lower-level mental) behaviours they are performing,
 they internalized them to a large extent and thus are no longer necessarily
 able to make these deliberations and motor behaviours explicit.

Goal Representations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One kind of panalogy, and one that fundamentally influences at least our
 normative self-models, is what we call “goal.” But, what are goals, with
 what are they linked, and how do we go about pursuing them?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, goals are in a hierarchical structure -- leaving intuition aside,
 this directly follows from the convolved holism constraint (4).
 The nature of goals then is more of a subject for psychological and didactical
 research than for philosophy or neurophysiology.
 Arguably, goals are not much more than bits of memory (grouped in panalogies)
 that have normative force.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bits of memory that can serve as goals are, so it seems, always (partial)
 self-models or (partial) world models -- a lot of money, a happy state
 of mind, love, peace on earth with fluffy bunnies everywhere.
 While executing actions, we can then as per the offline activation constraint
 (8) access those goal models, run mental simulations and compare the results
 of the actions in world zero to the goal states.
 Minsky describes this as a constent process where we describe the current
 state, compare it with a description of the desired state, select a difference
 through built-in difference detectors

Creativity is a subject that often comes up when the hard problem is being
 discussed, and indeed it is an important part of intelligence.
 As a matter of fact, Minsky goes even further and claims that resourcefulness
 (which he describes as having many ways to think available and thus being
 able to approach problems from many different angles -- which is arguably
 the same thing as creativity) is one of the three defining characteristics
 of intelligence, together with persistence and aim.

Since all these things rely on representations of memories and goals, on
 how many ways to think were obtained how and what goals and subgoals are
 active at the moment, this leads to a very unpredictable behaviour, particularl
y from a third-person point of view.
 And unpredictability is exactly the thing that makes creativity special,
 and that makes it intuitively impossible for machines to have it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arguably however, given sufficiently chaotic inputs (and maybe some deeper
 forms of randomness than our current approaches handle, since quantum effects
 will most probably influence what's happening in the brain), it is not
 impossible for another resourceful system to exhibit creative behaviour.

 To quote Bill Joy: “What we do suggest is that the human race might easily
 permit itself to drift into a position of such dependence on the machines
 that it would have no practical choice but to accept all of the machines'
 decisions.
 As society and the problems that face it become more and more complex and
 machines become more and more intelligent, people will let machines make
 more of their decisions for them, simply because machine-made decisions
 will bring better results than man-made ones.
 Eventually a stage may be reached at which the decisions necessary to keep
 the system running will be so complex that human beings will be incapable
 of making them intelligently.
 At that stage the machines will be in effective control.”

But if we don't try and see if we can find out if these other systems can
 be intelligent, and then informedly talk about what exactly the premises
 are that make it impossible for them to be intelligent, we can't possibly
 know, and we should admit that.
 In all honesty, Searle's “special causal powers” do not fit that bill very
 well, particularly not if they're defined as “the things that make it impossibl

Correspondence theory is, at least at a first sight, very intuitive.
 Something can not be called a truth unless it actually really is true.
 In order to be actually really true, it has to correspond to some ideal
 of truth (similar to Platon's ideas).
 There are several problems with that approach however, as it seems to be
 impossible to find out what those ideals are.

The problem with introspection:

\begin_layout Standard
Similar arguments apply for empirical introspection.
 If we are to believe that we can introspectively gain proper knowledge
 about all aspects of our mental world we direct introspective attention
 at, we have to believe, like Descartes, that we cannot be wrong about our
 own mental states.

 states through introspection.

There are various counter-examples to that view however.

 The question whether those patients are still rational agents can reasonably
 be asked -- arguably, they are, since their rational argumentations are
 sound if one accepts the premise that they don't exist.
 As we will see, this is transparently given as unquestionably immediate
 for them, just like existence is given for us.

 But there are other, non-pathological cases that make the fallibility of
 introspective access evident as well:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
In one study, subjects were presented with four pairs of stockings and asked
 to indicate which pair had the highest quality.
 The leftmost pair was preferred by a factor of almost four to one.
 However, unbeknownst to the subjects, all four pairs of stockings were
 identical.
 Though position effects were clearly playing a role in the subjects’ choice,
 none of them identified position when asked to explain their reasoning,
 and those who were asked explicitly whether position played any role in
 their reasoning process all denied it.
 [...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
However interesting this result, Nisbett and Wilson’s work might not seem
 especially threatening to most proponents of infallibility, since it concerns
 introspective access only to higher order reasoning processes [...].
 In contrast, empirical work on “changeblindness,” which calls into question
 our introspective access to our current perceptual states, seems to pose
 a deeper threat.
 According to work done by Kevin O’Regan (who works, ironically, at the
 Universite Rene Descartes in France), subjects typically fail to notice
 even large changes to objects in their visual field, as long as the change
 occurs simultaneously with some other “disruption,” such as a blink or
 a mudsplash on a windshield.

I think that epistemology is, in fact, not such a complicated subject as
 we assume it to be -- and obviously, not as complicated as it seems from
 my discussion so far.
 The only way in which we can know whether a belief is not only justified,
 but also true, is if we assume things that imply verity in their very definitio
n (like intrinsic intentionality or dualism).
 Only due to these definitions and dogmatinc settings these things have
 verifying force, making the verifying force circular.
 It is the classic Münchhausen trilemma we are faced with, of course.
 When attempting to justify any argumentation, we have the choice among
 the following three alternatives:

 This, again, applies to coherence, constructivist, consensus, and pragmatic

Adequacy can be proven wrong by means of examples of inadequacy for any

 This is actually the most common kind of adequate belief we hold as knowledge.
 The saying

 is well-known.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is somewhat opposed to putting blind faith in any kind of supreme authority.
 Any such supreme authorities like books or god-like entities that are not
 merely widely accepted as such, but actually provide an ontological foundation,
 are highly improbable -- and even if they exist, we cannot possibly know
 which of the various entities that are offered as being the one true supreme
 authority happens to be the correct one.
\begin_inset Foot

Strictly speaking, it's rarely the god-like entities that are considered
 to be the last authority, but rather the various memes that cultures built
 around their own interpretations of these god-like entities.
 The rational legitimation of those memes does rest on an understanding
 of the memes being given by the god-like entity itself -- and this is what
 seems to give the religious books, the holders of common and accepted memes,
 their perceived normative power.

 On the other hand, I believe
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is strictly a matter of belief, since it can not be argued on a rational

 As soon as rational discussion is used as a means of conviction, it is
 also accepted as supremely authoritative.
 On the other hand, if I do not accept rational discussion as authoritative
 and having more justification than whatever supreme authorities I believe
 in, it cannot be used to convince me otherwise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems to me that merely relying on rationality and logic rather than

 some actual real truth.
 We cannot know whether it does.

 essentially is the postulation of two kinds of essences: A physical, nonthinkin

 thinking essence (which builds the mind).
 Thus, it is the separation of body and mind, and it did not really start
 with Descartes -- it dates back to Zarathushtra, Plato and Aristotle.

 They all postulate that there is more to the world than the physical, and
 more importantly, they postulate that this additional matter is not traceable

 Essentially, they postulate that there is a kind of causation that is not

 Looking at the original Cartesian version that puts the

\begin_layout Quotation
How, precisely, does the information get transmitted from pineal gland to
 mind? [...] let's ignore those upbound signals for the time being, and concentrate
 on the return signals, the directives from mind to brain.
 These, 
\emph on
ex hypothesi
\emph default
, are not physical [...].
 No physical energy or mass is associated with them.
 How, then, do they get to make a difference to what happens in the brain
 cells they must affect, if the mind is to have any influence over the body?
 A fundamental principle of physics is that any change in the trajectory
 of any physical entity is an acceleration requiring the expenditure of
 energy, and where is this energy to come from?

A hidden form of dualism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to openly dualist theories, many recent philosophers still have
 hidden dualist (intuitive) premises when looking at a world they perceive
 as naturalist.
 Searle for example posits special causal powers that are not necessarily
 replicable by a formal program.
 His argument is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
I offer no a priori proof that a system of integrated circuit chips couldn't
 have intentionality.
 That is, as I say repeatedly, an empirical question.
 What I do argue is that in order to produce intentionality the system would
 have to duplicate the causal powers of the brain and that simply instantiating
 a formal program would not be sufficient for that.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
[...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Now I argue at some length that [the circuit chips] couldn't have intentionality
 solely in virtue of instantiating the program.
 Once you see that the program doesn't necessarily add intentionality to
 the system, it then becomes an empirical question which kinds of systems
 really do have intentionality, and the condition necessary for that is
 that they must have causal powers equivalent to those of the brain.

 mere machine -- since no mere machine can calculate incomputable functions.

 that conscious experience can, as a matter of fact, take place

 It is the idea that there is a central, clearly localizable place of

 in the brain.
 The idea that there is a locus of understanding, like a theater where everythin

 This would make understanding experience a lot easier:

 And vice versa: If we could say exactly when it happened, we could say
 where in the brain conscious experience was located.

 Since there is no such clearly definable point of understanding, neither
 in space nor in time, there can't possibly (from a scientific perspective)
 be a Cartesian Theater of any kind anyway.

But a Cartesian Theater additionally has metaphysical problems, too:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
The Cartesian Theater may be a comforting image because it preserves the
 reality/appearance distinction at the heart of human subjectivity, but
 as well as being scientifically unmotivated, this is metaphysically dubious,
 because it creates the bizarre category of the objectively subjective --
 the way things, actually, objectively seem to you even if they don't seem
 to seem that way to you!

Those things would, of course, be the ways in which content is produced
 in that Cartesian Theater locus, if it would be interpreted (by the audience)
 to have another meaning than the presenting mechanisms (the actors) intended
 it.
 You see, the trouble goes deeper than the quote itself even mentions, as
 this would also require intention and possibly intentionality on both sides
 of the Cartesian Theater stage, in both the actors and the audience.
 The Cartesian Theater, even if it existed, would thus fail to explain anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dennett explains how there really can't be a Cartesian Theater if we do
 not commit to dualism, and conversely, how if we do not want to commit
 to dualism we cannot believe that there is a Cartesian Theater:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
When you discard Cartesian dualism, you really must discard the show that
 would have gone on in the Cartesian Theater, and the audience as well,
 for neither the show nor the audience is to be found in the brain, and
 the brain is the only real place there is to look for them.

Supervenience
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Supervenience is an attempt at finding a concept that can explain the apparent
 dualism between mind and body.
 Supervenience as a term was introduced by Donald Davidson:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Although the position I describe denies there are psychophysical laws, it
 is consistent with the view that mental characteristics are in some sense
 dependent, or supervenient, on physical characteristics.
 Such supervenience might be taken to mean that there cannot be two events
 alike in all physical respects but differing in some mental respect, or
 that an object cannot alter in some mental respect without altering in
 some physical respect.
 Dependence or supervenience of this kind does not ential reducibility through
 law or definition; if it did, we could reduce moral properties to descriptive,
 and this there is good reason to 
\emph on
believe
\emph default
 cannot be done; and we might be able to reduce truth in a formal system
 to syntactical properties, and this we 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 cannot in general be done.

Thomas Metzinger on the other hand agrees that it is impracticable to attempt
 to reduce mental events to physical events, but does not say that they
 are irreducible in principle.
 Quite the opposite, he proposes a model that could enable such a reduction:
 functional clusters of neurons,

 As he writes about such functional clusters,

this island of causal density is constituted by a certain subset of neural

Will evolution be called into question now that the similarity of chimpanzee

 Regardless of whether the similarity was reduced even below 90%, evolutionists
 would still believe that humans and apes shared a common ancestor.

Note how this is not a theory about random things just miraculously happening

 Rather, it is a very brutal theory about a big sample of small, incremental
 changes being implemented and tested all the time, and most of these changes
 being dismissed as not fitting -- through death of the individuals carrying
 unfitting gene changes.
 Given a large enough sample, there have to be some changes that make the
 offspring better adapted.
 Those (and the ones that are don't influence the chances of survival at
 all) are the only ones that persevere.
 All the others die.

Selfish Genes

\begin_layout Standard
Eventhough it is not entirely undisputed, I will also adopt Dawkins' view
 on natural selection and evolution not being a purpose in and of itself,
 and animals being mere vehicles that enable the survival of our genes.
 As he writes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
We, and all other animals, are machines created by our genes.
 [...] Our genes have survived, in some cases for millions of years, in a highly
 competitive world.
 [...] I shall argue that a predominant quality to be expected in a successful
 gene is ruthless selfishness.
 This gene selfishness will usually give rise to selfishness in individual
 behaviour.
 However, as we shall see, there are special circumstances in which a gene
 can achieve its own selfish goals best by fostering a limited form of altruism
 at the level of individual animals.
 [...] Much as we might wish to believe otherwise, universal love and welfare
 of the species as a whole are concepts that simply do not make evolutionary
 sense.

\begin_layout Standard
So, animals are essentially selfish, unless altruism benefits the survival
 of its genes.
 In some cases, altruism goes very far: Sometimes, an individual animal
 acting suicidal actually benefits the reproduction of its genes, like when
 bees die after stinging an enemy of the hive, or birds risk their lives
 to warn the flock of an approaching hawk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is very important to note that Dawkins did not mean to say that genes
 are selfish in any self-aware sense.
 They merely are selfish in that only those genes survive that are predisposed
 in ways that make them produce forms of life that has high odds of reproduction
, and thus is able to further the population of a particular genotype and
 produce more of these genes.
 In this sense, only selfish genes survive, while all genes that are not
 selfish necessarily die.
 So, all genes that actually do survive must be selfish.
 But this does not imply any kind of intrinsic intentionality of genes or
 the likes.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Metzinger:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Teleofunctionalism in the way Metzinger uses it appears to be the following
 assumption: Given there is a system that developed in an evolutionary process.
 Every functional property of that system was itself developed in this evolution
ary process, and was selected due to evolutionary fitness in the particular
 niche the system was adapting to.
 So for every functional property of a system, there was a goal that its
 implementation served, and that goal was in turn beneficial for the reproductio
n of the genotype in question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This view might seem a bit radical, and it finds its culmination in the
 adaptivity constraint that we'll look at in chapters 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "Adaptivity"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "Weaker-Adaptivity"

\end_inset

.
 Personally, I am rather certain that there are mutations and functional
 properties that do not have a teleofunctionalist justification like that
 -- mutations that are 
\emph on
not detrimental
\emph default
 (as opposed to 
\emph on
strictly beneficial
\emph default
) for a genotype's continued existence can just as well survive reproductive
 and adaptive activity.
 For consciousness itself however, being very complex and very fragile,
 I imagine that teleofunctionalism applies to a large extent, and as such
 I believe that I can and will adopt it for my thesis.

Dennett:

 volounteers (all the parts of the brain that had goal representations and
 produced action dispositions) had to organize themselves into one stream
 of thought, since the body can only do one thing at a time.

Autostimulation (for example, talking to oneself as a way to solve a problem)
 is a way to invoke resources that were only used when our ancestors were

 we have ourselves.

Notably, Dennett doesn't offer explicit proof or even models for every one
 such step, but he drafts a reasonable theory regarding how evolutionary
 pressure made consciousness what it is today.
 He also notes that while evolutionary pressure was long the driving force
 behind adaptations of the genome for new tricks a species learned, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the tricks [of consciousness] have so altered the nature of the environment
 for our species that there is no longer significant selection pressure
 calling for further hard-wiring.

Suitcase Words

In true Wittgensteinian tradition, Minksky points out how often, we seem
 to see problems where there really wouldn't be any if we would just use
 fitting terminology.

The particular problem that Minsky sees is that in psychology, we often
 use just one word to describe an entire suitcase of concepts.
 He first introduces the term of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

suitcase words
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 early on in his book, asking: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Why do we pack such dissimilar things into those suitcase-like words?

 He then goes on to define them further, saying that

 is one of those suitcaselike words that we use to conceal the complexity
 of very large ranges of different things whose relationships we don't yet

Only later in the book does he offer speculations on why we seem to have
 so many suitcase words (and not just in psychology), looking at it from
 different angles:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Psychologist: Suitcase words are useful in everyday life when they help
 us to communicate.
 But we won't know what each other means unless we share the same jumbles
 of ideas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Psychiatrist: We often use those suitcase words to keep us from asking questions
 about ourselves.
 Just having a name for an answer can make us feel as though we actually
 have the answer itself.

\begin_layout Quotation
Ethicist: we need the idea of consciousness to support our beliefs about
 responsibility and discipline.
 Our legal and ethical principles are largely based on the idea that we
 should only censure

 acts, that is, ones that have been planned in advance, with awareness about

Holist: Although many processes may be involved, we'll still need to explain

The important philosophical lesson we can draw from this is relatively simple:
 We should stay the course after the linguistic turn, and keep questioning
 everything that our language implies.
 If that means breaking up tried and treasured concepts, so be it.
 Although Minsky does have a word of caution for us as well:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
I am not suggesting that we should try to dissect and replace all our suitcase-w
ords, because they incorporate ambiguities that have evolved over centuries,
 to serve many important purposes -- but also, they often handicap us by
 preserving outdated concepts.

 It is not the case that something is necessarily not true merely because
 we cannot imagine it being true.
 We are built a certain way, with certain dispositions that helped us survive
 for long enough to stand where we are now.
 Those dispositions were (and most of them, are) adequate for survival,
 and not necessarily epistemical insights into reality.

There is a fundamental problem about us looking at what constitutes consciousnes
s and in particular selfhood: The epistemic irreducibility of conscious
 experience, the fact that it is tied to a first-person perspective, may
 be explainable, but it is not possible to be truly convinced (which is
 necessary to make it intuitively plausible) by such an explanation.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is because either we agree with the possibility and coherence of the
 explanation, but do that from a still experienced phenomenal first-person
 perspective that we cannot drop, thus forming a conflict that cannot be
 resolved without internal contradictions in our belief system.
 Or we abandon the first-person perspective completely in some form of enlighten
ment, but then (even if us humans are even able to reach that state) have
 no subject anymore that can be convinced of the truth of any such theory.

An example for the evolutionary pressure that made intuition just the way
 it is: When a huge grizzly bear comes charging at a caveman, he doesn't
 survive if he ponders whether he's just imagining or dreaming that, or
 whether it's actually a bear after all.
 The cavemen that survive are the ones that experience phenomenally perceived
 events as immediate and unquestionably real.

 But I do believe that scientific theories in a wider sense could in theory
 be formed that contain all the answers.
 It also means that I believe that some basic principles of science (mostly,
 conclusive logic, causal analysis and semantical coherence) will lead us
 to a better understanding of the world that we have just started to grasp.

Reductive naturalism does seem to have legitimation even when we look at

 subjects:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Today, it only seems safe to say two things: Phenomenal content as such
 is not epistemically justified content, and it locally supervenes on brain
 properties.
 A brain in a vat could generate the conscious experience of thinking 
\emph on
[I am certain that I* exist]
\emph default
.
 Cotard's syndrome patients can generate the conscious experience of thinking
 
\emph on
[I am certain that I* do not exist]
\emph default
.
 It is therefore plausible that a minimally sufficient neural correlate
 for the phenomenal content characterizing the specific conscious experience
 of thinking 
\emph on
[I am certain that I* exist]
\emph default
 does exist.

My reasons for this are very similar to Dawkins' that he clarifies like
 this, concerning evolution -- I believe the maxim of his thought here should
 hold true for all aspects of our world views:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
If all the evidence in the universe turned in favour of creationism, I would
 be the first to admit it, and I would immediately change my mind.
 As things stand, however, all available evidence (and there is a vast amount
 of it) favours evolution.
 It is for this reason and this reason alone that I argue for evolution
 with a passion that matches the passion of those who argue against it.
 My passion is based on evidence.
 Theirs, flying in the face of evidence as it does, is truly fundamentalist.
